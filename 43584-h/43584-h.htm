<br /><i>A Real Detective</i></h2>
<p>Mary Louise stamped the snow from her feet
and removed her goloshes on the porch. Whistling
the Christmas carol her class had just sung
at school, she opened the door of her house and
stepped inside.</p>
<p>Her mother was sitting in an armchair in the
living room, sewing. She looked up with a smile
at her daughter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did your entertainment go?&rdquo; she inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Swell!&rdquo; replied Mary Louise enthusiastically.
&ldquo;The seniors were great. You should have
seen Max!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to have seen Mary Louise Gay,&rdquo;
mused her mother. &ldquo;But this snow&mdash;and your
father had the car&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_12">[12]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I wasn&rsquo;t so hot,&rdquo; laughed Mary Louise
modestly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you who was the star of the
afternoon&mdash;little Rosemary Dotts. She was so
funny. She forgot all of her piece except the
second line&mdash;&lsquo;I&rsquo;m going to have plum pudding!&rsquo;
Well, she said that once, and then she stared
around at the audience and repeated it. And still
she couldn&rsquo;t think of any more, so she said it
again, and rubbed her fat little tummy as she repeated
it. Well, she kept that up until I thought
we&rsquo;d just pass out laughing at her. Honestly, the
tears were rolling down my cheeks. Her teacher
had to come up to the platform and take her
away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That must have been funny,&rdquo; agreed Mrs.
Gay. &ldquo;Well, I guess you&rsquo;re thankful that it&rsquo;s all
over. How do you like this weather for your
vacation?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary Louise&rsquo;s brown eyes sparkled with
pleasure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s keen!&rdquo; she exclaimed. She executed a little
dance step in her joy. &ldquo;Two whole weeks with
nothing to do but coast and skate and dance!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And eat and sleep once in a while.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh yes, of course. Especially eat. What
would Christmas be without eating?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you going to do now?&rdquo; inquired
her mother.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go coasting. Max and Norman are bringing
the bobsled over in ten minutes, and Jane and I
are supposed to be ready.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_13">[13]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You better hurry, then. Get something to eat
first. And&mdash;I forgot to tell you&mdash;your father
wants to see you at half-past five this afternoon.
Be sure to be home in time. He said he wanted
to &lsquo;consult&rsquo; you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;About somebody&rsquo;s Christmas present? I
thought all our Christmas shopping was finished
last week.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was. This hasn&rsquo;t anything to do with presents,
but it concerns your Christmas vacation, I
believe,&rdquo; replied Mrs. Gay.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, that sounds exciting!&rdquo; exclaimed Mary
Louise. Mr. Gay was a detective on the police
force, and, knowing his daughter&rsquo;s keen interest
in the solution of crimes, he sometimes discussed
his cases with her. Already she had shown
marked ability in the same line herself by unraveling
two baffling mysteries the preceding
summer.</p>
<p>She ran out into the kitchen and poured out a
glass of milk for herself and cut a piece of chocolate
cake. This brisk weather certainly made her
feel hungry, and the refreshments tasted good.
Then she dashed upstairs to change into her
&ldquo;snow suit,&rdquo; a long-trousered costume that happened
to be popular with the older girls at the
moment. When she was all ready she opened her
side window and whistled to her chum, Jane
Patterson, who lived across the snow-covered
lawn in the house next door.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_14">[14]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yo, Jane!&rdquo; she called.</p>
<p>Immediately a corresponding window flew
up, and a youthful face appeared at the enclosure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ready!&rdquo; was the reply. &ldquo;The boys there yet?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I hear them,&rdquo; returned Mary Louise.
&ldquo;Come on over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The windows were slammed down simultaneously,
and the two girls dashed downstairs to
their porches. Before they had finished putting
on their goloshes, the boys were at the Gays&rsquo;
house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Left the sled at the gate,&rdquo; announced Max
Miller, Mary Louise&rsquo;s especial boy-friend in
Riverside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think the snow&rsquo;s packed hard
enough?&rdquo; demanded Jane.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hope so,&rdquo; returned Max, with a grin. &ldquo;The
kids were sledding last night over near Cooper&rsquo;s
woods, so they ought to have made a track.
Anyhow, we can have some fun. You&rsquo;ve just got
to be outdoors, weather like this.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_15">[15]</div>
<p>They made their way across the yard, chatting
about the school entertainment, their dates for
the next two weeks, and the fun which Christmas
always brought them. When they reached
the hill where the coasting was the best, near
Riverside, they found many of their other high-school
friends, and for two hours they alternately
rode down the steep incline at a breathtaking
speed and then trudged slowly back to
the top. The sun was setting, and the afternoon
was gone before they knew it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I must go home!&rdquo; exclaimed Mary Louise,
glancing at her wrist-watch in amazement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s only five o&rsquo;clock,&rdquo; returned Max complacently.
&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t eat at your house before
six-thirty, do you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on, Mary Lou!&rdquo; called Jane. &ldquo;All
aboard!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her chum shook her head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t, Jane. I&rsquo;ve got to be home by five-thirty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why the rush?&rdquo; demanded Max.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have to see my father. He left word with
Mother for me to be there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you can see him at supper,&rdquo; observed
Jane lightly. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t want to break up the
party, do you?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_16">[16]</div>
<p>&ldquo;No, of course not. No need for that at all.
I&rsquo;ll just run along by myself. You people take
some more rides.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nix,&rdquo; answered Max loyally. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not
going home alone past these woods. If you have
to go, Mary Lou, I&rsquo;ll go too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, we might as well all go,&rdquo; said Jane. &ldquo;I
suppose it wouldn&rsquo;t hurt to be on time for a meal
once in a while. Still, I don&rsquo;t see what all the
fuss is about.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Max looked straight into Mary Louise&rsquo;s eyes,
a serious expression on his face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mary Lou,&rdquo; he asked, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re not doing any
more detective stuff, are you? Surely last summer
was enough!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it was plenty. Haven&rsquo;t I been pretty
good all fall? Never tried to listen in on any of
Dad&rsquo;s cases or hunt for clues!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should think you&rsquo;d be cured,&rdquo; remarked
Jane. &ldquo;The whole town could burn down before
I&rsquo;d go through an experience like yours last
summer, to discover a criminal. And if it hadn&rsquo;t
been for Max and Norman&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I owe them my life!&rdquo; said Mary Louise, half
seriously and half smilingly. But in her heart she
felt a deep sense of gratitude to her two youthful
rescuers.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_17">[17]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Max could use it,&rdquo; remarked Norman slyly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll say I could,&rdquo; muttered the other young
man fervently. &ldquo;But you really don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;ll
do dangerous things again, do you, Mary Lou?&rdquo;
he asked eagerly. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll leave the solving of
mysteries and crimes to your father hereafter,
won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary Louise&rsquo;s eyes twinkled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not making any rash promises. It sort of
gets into the blood, Max. There&rsquo;s no other thrill
like it. I&rsquo;d rather solve a mystery than eat....
But I really don&rsquo;t think there is anything for me
to solve now. So you can put your mind at rest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll feel safer after this talk with your father
is over,&rdquo; returned the young man.</p>
<p>They came to a hill, and the subject was forgotten
as they all piled on the sled and rode down
together.</p>
<p class="tb">It was only a little past five-thirty when Mary
Louise opened the door of her house. Her father
was already there, beside the roaring logs in the
fireplace, comfortably smoking.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_18">[18]</div>
<p>Mr. Gay was a tall, impressive-looking man,
with a determined jaw which announced to the
world that he usually accomplished whatever
he set out to do. He was proud of his daughter&rsquo;s
detective work that summer, and delighted to
have her follow in his footsteps, though he
wished he might keep her always from the more
gruesome features in the pursuit of crimes and
criminals.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello, Mary Lou!&rdquo; he called, gazing admiringly
at her rosy cheeks and sparkling eyes. &ldquo;Did
you have a good time?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wonderful!&rdquo; she replied, hanging up her
snowflaked coat. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry to be late, Dad, but
I had a hard time getting the others home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right, Daughter. It won&rsquo;t take long
for me to tell you what I have in mind. It may
take longer for you to decide upon your answer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary Louise sat down opposite him and
waited expectantly, not saying another word.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is a small hotel for women in Philadelphia,&rdquo;
he began. &ldquo;It is a pretty up-to-date
place, though they try to keep their rates down,
because it is endowed, and supposedly was
started for girls in moderate circumstances. They
have been having some trouble lately, valuables
have been stolen&mdash;and they are practically sure
that none of the servants is guilty. So they want
a detective.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_19">[19]</div>
<p>&ldquo;A detective?&rdquo; repeated Mary Louise breathlessly.
&ldquo;You mean&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I mean you, Mary Lou. The proposition
was put up to me, and naturally I can&rsquo;t handle it
myself. I was to find them a woman detective for
a week or so, and I suggested you. The woman in
charge is delighted. She said a young girl like
you could work better than anyone else because
no one would suspect you of being a detective.
And you could have a room near hers, under her
protection, you see.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now the great question is: would you want
to give up your holiday for this purpose? All
those engagements you have&mdash;all the fun you
have planned with your young friends? Christmas
Day alone in a strange city? Would it be
worth it to you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>It did not take Mary Louise a moment to
make her decision.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d love it, Dad!&rdquo; she cried ecstatically. &ldquo;But
I shouldn&rsquo;t know how to go about it,&rdquo; she added
hesitatingly. &ldquo;What to do&mdash;how to begin.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_20">[20]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Hilliard&mdash;she is the hotel manager&mdash;would
give you all the facts,&rdquo; explained her
father. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d go with you and get you started. But
you must consider carefully, Mary Lou. Think
of your friends and your mother and your own
pleasures. You can let me know tomorrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary Louise nodded solemnly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know, Daddy. But this seems like the
chance of a lifetime. Because you see I mean to
be a detective when I graduate from high school.
This is something definite to go on&mdash;a real experience,
which I can make use of when I apply
for a job.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, of course. And, by the way, there is a
salary attached. You are to get twenty-five dollars
a week, and an extra bonus if you get any of
the lost valuables back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Daddy!&rdquo; The exclamation was almost a
whisper, so awed was Mary Louise at the
thought of actually earning money in the work
that she loved best in all the world.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When would I start?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I could take you with me to Philadelphia tomorrow
morning. But that wouldn&rsquo;t give you
much time to write notes to your friends and
pack your things. I suppose you&rsquo;d have a lot of
engagements to break.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but they don&rsquo;t matter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you want to think it over another day?
I could come back and take you after the weekend.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_21">[21]</div>
<p>&ldquo;No, Daddy, there&rsquo;s not a question of doubt
in my mind. I want to try it and start as soon as
possible. Some of the crowd will be at Jane&rsquo;s tonight,
and I can tell them and phone to the
others. I&rsquo;ll pack my clothes before I go. Have
you told Mother yet?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I haven&rsquo;t. I thought there was no use stirring
her up if you didn&rsquo;t care to undertake it.
But now we&rsquo;ll have to break the news to her, if
you&rsquo;re sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You tell her, Daddy!&rdquo; urged Mary Louise.
&ldquo;It will be easier.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, I will,&rdquo; he promised.</p>
<p>A voice sounded from the kitchen. &ldquo;Mary
Louise, could you do an errand for me? You&rsquo;ll
just have time before supper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Mother,&rdquo; replied the girl, jumping to
her feet. Then in a whisper to her father she
added, &ldquo;Tell her while I&rsquo;m gone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Picking up her coat again, she ran out into
the kitchen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want you to take this basket of jellies and
fruit cake over to old Mrs. Detweiler,&rdquo; said
Mrs. Gay. &ldquo;I think it would be nice for them to
have the things earlier this year, because they
have so little at Christmas time.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_22">[22]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes it would, Mother,&rdquo; agreed the girl absently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ask them whether they&rsquo;ve heard anything
from Margaret,&rdquo; added Mrs. Gay. &ldquo;Maybe she&rsquo;s
coming home for Christmas.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She wasn&rsquo;t home all summer, was she,
Mother?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. And they didn&rsquo;t hear from her, either.
They&rsquo;re terribly worried. I can&rsquo;t see why Margaret
Detweiler would do a thing like that,
when her grandparents have been so good to her
all her life. Why, Mrs. Detweiler wore the same
dress for five years just so she could put Margaret
through high school. And the girl always
seemed so grateful and affectionate, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe something happened to her,&rdquo; suggested
Mary Louise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Surely they would have heard if it had....
Well, run along, dear. And come right back, because
dinner is practically ready.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary Louise pulled on her beret and her
goloshes and went out into the snow again. It
was entirely dark now, but the stars were shining,
and the air was just cold enough to be invigorating.
How good it was to be young and
lively and happy! How sorry she felt for this
poor old couple whom she was visiting, missing
their granddaughter so dreadfully. But perhaps
everything was all right. Maybe Margaret Detweiler
was coming home for Christmas.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_23">[23]</div>
<p>The small brick house where the old couple
lived was only a few blocks from Mary Louise&rsquo;s
home. Half walking, half running, the girl covered
the distance in less than ten minutes. She
saw a low light in the living room and knocked
at the door.</p>
<p>Both of the Detweilers were well over seventy,
and they lived modestly but comfortably on a
small pension which Mr. Detweiler received.
It had been sufficient for their needs until the
death of Margaret&rsquo;s parents obliged them to take
care of their only grandchild. But they had
gladly sacrificed everything to give Margaret an
education and a happy girlhood. She was older
than Mary Louise by three or four years, so that
the latter had never known her well. But she had
always seemed like a sweet girl.</p>
<p>Mr. Detweiler opened the door and insisted
that Mary Louise come inside. Both the old people
loved Mrs. Gay and enjoyed the wonderful
presents of her own making she sent every
Christmas. They were profuse in their thanks.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_24">[24]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You must take off your things and get warm
before you start out again,&rdquo; urged Mrs. Detweiler.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m really not a bit cold,&rdquo; replied Mary
Louise. &ldquo;And Mother told me to come right
back, as supper will be waiting. But she wanted
me to ask you whether you had heard anything
from Margaret.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tears came to the old lady&rsquo;s eyes, and she
shook her head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a thing since last Christmas,&rdquo; she answered
sadly. &ldquo;You know she didn&rsquo;t come home
then, but she wrote to us and sent us a box of
lovely presents. Expensive things, so I knew she
must be doing well. She had a position in a Harrisburg
store at first, you know, and then she told
us she had gotten a fine job in a Philadelphia
store. That was where the last letter came from&mdash;the
last we ever received from her!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you write to her?&rdquo; asked Mary Louise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, of course we did. But the letter was returned
to us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What store was she working in? I am going
to Philadelphia for the Christmas holidays, and
I might be able to find her.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_25">[25]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure. But the package was marked
&lsquo;Strawbridge and Clothier&rsquo; on the box. Did you
ever hear of that store?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I did. And I&rsquo;ll go there and make inquiries
for you, Mrs. Detweiler.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old lady seized Mary Louise&rsquo;s hand
gratefully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, if you could only find her, Mary Louise,&rdquo;
she exclaimed, &ldquo;we&rsquo;d be the happiest couple
alive!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do the best I can,&rdquo; promised the girl as
she turned to the door.</p>
<p>She ran all the way home, eager to find out
what her mother was going to say in reply to her
father&rsquo;s startling proposition about her Christmas
vacation.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_26">[26]</div>
<h2 id="c2"><span class="small">CHAPTER II</span>
<br /><i>The Job</i></h2>
<p>If Mrs. Gay did not like the idea of losing her
daughter for two weeks, at least she kept the
feeling to herself. She congratulated Mary Louise
heartily on being chosen for a difficult piece
of work.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a lucky girl!&rdquo; cried Freckles, Mary
Louise&rsquo;s young brother. &ldquo;Wish I was old enough
to take the job!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You couldn&rsquo;t take this one, Son,&rdquo; his father
reminded him, &ldquo;because it&rsquo;s a woman&rsquo;s job. A
man would be out of place in a woman&rsquo;s hotel.
But Mary Lou can go about unnoticed&mdash;people
will think she&rsquo;s just a guest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Twenty-five bucks a week!&rdquo; repeated
Freckles. &ldquo;What are you going to do with all
that money, Sis?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. Wait and see if I earn it. But
if I do, we&rsquo;ll all have something nice out of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t asking for it!&rdquo; protested the boy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_27">[27]</div>
<p>&ldquo;No, I know you weren&rsquo;t. But wait, and we&rsquo;ll
see.&rdquo; She turned to her mother. &ldquo;The Detweilers
haven&rsquo;t heard a thing from Margaret, Mother.
Not since they received a box last Christmas
from Philadelphia. But I promised to try to
hunt her up for them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I feel so sorry for them!&rdquo; exclaimed Mrs.
Gay. &ldquo;I do hope that nothing has happened to
Margaret.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So do I. But, anyhow, that will give me two
jobs in Philadelphia.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; agreed her father, &ldquo;and you can give
that as your reason for being in Philadelphia&mdash;to
the other guests at the hotel&mdash;if you care to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s an idea,&rdquo; said Mary Louise. &ldquo;And
maybe this is the more important of the two. I&rsquo;m
sure Margaret Detweiler is more precious to
her grandparents than money and valuables to
the women at that hotel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Though her mother accepted the situation
calmly&mdash;owing to her father&rsquo;s persuasion, no
doubt&mdash;Mary Louise found her best friends less
agreeable. Jane raised a howl of protest when
she heard of the plan, and Max Miller looked
so crushed and unhappy that for a moment or
two Mary Louise even considered the idea of
giving the whole thing up.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_28">[28]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I asked you two months ago to go to the
senior dance during Christmas week,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;And you promised me faithfully, Mary Lou!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know, Max. But I couldn&rsquo;t foresee anything
like this coming up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It spoils my whole vacation. It spoils my
whole senior year, because this is the biggest
affair we have.... In fact, it spoils my whole
life!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, Max, be reasonable! We&rsquo;d have only a
few dances together&mdash;you&rsquo;re class president,
don&rsquo;t forget, and you&rsquo;ll need to perform your
social duties&mdash;and any other girl will do as your
partner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No other girl will do at all,&rdquo; he protested
stubbornly. &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t take anybody else. I&rsquo;ll go
stag. I&rsquo;d stay home entirely if I weren&rsquo;t president!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, maybe I&rsquo;ll have the whole mystery
solved in the week before Christmas, and get
home in time for the dance,&rdquo; remarked Mary
Louise optimistically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;More likely you&rsquo;ll stay a week overtime,&rdquo;
muttered the young man. &ldquo;Or maybe take on the
job for good and never come back to Riverside
at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary Louise laughed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_29">[29]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You certainly can dish out gloom when you
want to, Max! You don&rsquo;t suppose my parents
would allow me to leave high school and take a
regular job when I&rsquo;m only sixteen, do you? I
shan&rsquo;t be seventeen till next spring, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Max refused to be consoled, and Jane Patterson
upheld him in his attitude. It was ridiculous,
foolhardy, dumb, silly&mdash;every adjective she
could think of&mdash;to go to a strange city and be all
alone during Christmas week when you could be
having a perfectly wonderful time in Riverside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll get to be a dried-up old maid by the
time you&rsquo;re twenty-five,&rdquo; she told her chum.
&ldquo;And what good will your career be to you
then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lots of good,&rdquo; returned Mary Louise complacently.
&ldquo;If I&rsquo;m going to be an old maid, I&rsquo;ll
certainly want a career. But I don&rsquo;t see why a
career should interfere with marriage. I&rsquo;ll have
plenty of time to have it first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All the men will be married by that time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take a chance,&rdquo; laughed Mary Louise.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_30">[30]</div>
<p>Nothing anybody said could stop her. Mary
Louise was more thrilled than she had ever been
in her life, and she meant to put her whole soul
into this job. Not only for her own sake, but for
her father&rsquo;s, as well. In her two previous experiences,
personal inclination had made her unravel
the mysteries, but now she felt that her
father&rsquo;s reputation was involved. If he recommended
someone who was incompetent, a failure
would reflect upon him. Oh, she must succeed&mdash;if
it were humanly possible!</p>
<p>She left the party early that evening and
went home to finish packing her suitcase. Immediately
after breakfast the next morning she and
her father took the train to Philadelphia.</p>
<p>The snow had ceased falling, but the country
was still covered with white. The sun shone, and
the landscape was lovely. Mary Louise had
never been to Philadelphia before, and she
watched everything eagerly as she approached
the terminal. It was a big city, in comparison
with Riverside or even Harrisburg. But not so
big as New York, which she had visited several
times.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is the hotel, Daddy?&rdquo; she asked as
they left the train. &ldquo;And what is its name?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is up near the Parkway, and it is called
&lsquo;Stoddard House,&rsquo; because a wealthy woman by
the name of Stoddard left some money in her
will to build it and help keep it up. It is a very
attractive place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder how many rooms it has,&rdquo; said his
daughter.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_31">[31]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Not so many as you might expect, because I
understand the whole first floor is planned for
the girls&rsquo; social uses. A card room, several small
rooms for the girls to entertain callers, a library,
a larger reception room for dancing, and the
dining room are all part of the plan. But you&rsquo;ll
soon go all over the place and see for yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary Louise&rsquo;s eyes sparkled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is going to be thrilling, Dad!&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope you don&rsquo;t run into any danger,&rdquo; he
remarked a little apprehensively. &ldquo;The Philadelphia
police will have your name on file&mdash;I
saw to that&mdash;so the minute you call for help you
can get it. And don&rsquo;t hesitate to phone me long
distance any time you need me. I&rsquo;ll give you my
list of addresses for the week. Don&rsquo;t stop for expense&mdash;we
can&rsquo;t consider money in cases like
this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary Louise nodded proudly. Never in her
life had she been so happy. She walked along
beside her father with her head high and her
eyes shining. Her only misgiving, as they approached
the hotel, was caused by her extreme
youth. She hoped fervently that nobody would
guess her age.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_32">[32]</div>
<p>The hotel was an attractive place. Set back
from the street by a small terrace, its trim brick
walls and white-painted doorway and windows
looked cozy and home-like. What a nice place to
live, Mary Louise thought, if you weren&rsquo;t lucky
enough to have a home of your own!</p>
<p>How thankful she was that the place wasn&rsquo;t
gloomy and tumbledown like Dark Cedars,
where she had made her first investigations as
an amateur detective! Nobody would be telling
her that ghosts haunted the walls of Stoddard
House.</p>
<p>Her father opened the door for her, and she
preceded him into the lobby. It was rather small,
as lobbies go, with only one counter-desk, one
lounge, and a couple of elevators, which you
worked yourself, at the side. But doors opened
out from the lobby on all sides, revealing
glimpses of numerous attractive reception rooms
beyond.</p>
<p>Mr. Gay nodded to the girl at the desk and
inquired for Mrs. Hilliard. In a couple of minutes
a stout middle-aged woman appeared and
smiled pleasantly at him. He introduced Mary
Louise.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_33">[33]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get back into my office where we can
talk undisturbed,&rdquo; suggested Mrs. Hilliard,
leading the way out of a door and along a hall
to another smaller room. &ldquo;Now sit down and
I&rsquo;ll tell you all about our difficulties.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Gay and his daughter made themselves
comfortable, and Mary Louise took out her notebook.
The same notebook which she had made
so valuable on two previous occasions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Last September was the first time we ever
had any trouble at all,&rdquo; began Mrs. Hilliard.
&ldquo;We lost a complete set of silverware&mdash;a dozen
each of knives, forks, and spoons. But as these
were only plated, the loss did not run into a
great deal of money, so we didn&rsquo;t make much
fuss. I supposed that one of the maids stole them&mdash;a
waitress who left the next day to be married.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I must have been mistaken, for more
things disappeared after she left. A very unusual
vase we had in the library, quite valuable
too, for it had belonged in the Stoddard family.
That made it look as if the thief were a connoisseur.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The matron and I were watching the help
carefully, and we felt sure that none of them was
responsible. We hadn&rsquo;t many guests at the time&mdash;there
are only about a dozen who live here
permanently. And there happened to be only a
couple of transients.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_34">[34]</div>
<p>&ldquo;What are &lsquo;transients,&rsquo; Mrs. Hilliard?&rdquo; asked
Mary Louise, who was unfamiliar with the term.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re the people who stop in for a day or
two&mdash;or even a week&mdash;and don&rsquo;t stay permanently,&rdquo;
explained the other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should think they&rsquo;d be the people who
would be most likely to steal,&rdquo; observed Mary
Louise. &ldquo;Because they could get away with it
more easily.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought so too, at first. But when things
kept right on being stolen, and the same transients
never came back, it began to look to me as
if one of the permanent lodgers were responsible....
These two girls&mdash;I have forgotten
their names&mdash;were here when the silverware and
the vase disappeared, but they were not here in
October when our watches were taken.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How many watches?&rdquo; asked Mary Louise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Four&mdash;including my own!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And were there any transients here at that
time?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just one. A chorus girl named Mary Green.
She stayed a couple of days and then said her
show was closing up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young detective wrote all these facts into
her notebook and asked whether that was all.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_35">[35]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Not quite,&rdquo; replied Mrs. Hilliard. &ldquo;Last
Friday Miss Violet Granger had a valuable oil
painting stolen from her room, and a purse containing
fifty dollars.... So you see the situation
has become pretty serious. Two of our
regular guests have moved away because of it,
and others have threatened to do so if anything
else is stolen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She looked doubtfully at Mary Louise. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
sure I don&rsquo;t know how you would go about an
investigation like this,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;But perhaps
you do. Are you willing to try it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course I am!&rdquo; cried the girl eagerly. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
just the kind of thing I love. I&rsquo;ve put down
everything you said, Mrs. Hilliard, and I&rsquo;m
all ready to go to work now. I want to see the
hotel and meet the guests as soon as possible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think Mary Louise had better keep secret
the fact that she is spying on them,&rdquo; put in Mr.
Gay. &ldquo;Just let them think that she is a young
friend of yours, Mrs. Hilliard, visiting you for
her Christmas vacation. As a matter of fact, she
wants to look up a young girl from Riverside,
whose whereabouts have been lost by her relations.
But use your own discretion, Mrs. Hilliard.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_36">[36]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I will, Mr. Gay,&rdquo; agreed the woman. &ldquo;And
I will take good care of Mary Louise for you,&rdquo;
she added.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. No late hours&mdash;or being out
alone at night, Mary Lou. Don&rsquo;t forget that this
is a big city, and girls can easily get lost.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be careful, Daddy,&rdquo; she promised.</p>
<p>Mr. Gay kissed his daughter good-bye, and
Mary Louise and Mrs. Hilliard took the elevator
to the second floor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are ten rooms on each floor,&rdquo; the manager
explained. &ldquo;The fourth floor belongs to the
help, and I have my own little three-room apartment
at the back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The third floor is reserved for our permanent
guests. We have thirteen of them now&mdash;some
two in a room, some alone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our second floor is principally for transients,
although sometimes guests prefer to live there
permanently. One woman named Mrs. Macgregor,
a wealthy widow, likes her room and
bath so much that she has decided to keep it indefinitely.
But most of the guests on the second
floor come and go....</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_37">[37]</div>
<p>&ldquo;And now, my dear, here is your room. I was
going to take you into my own apartment at first,
but I decided that would be too far away from
everybody. Here you can mix more with the
other guests. Of course, whenever you get lonely,
you can come up with me. I have some nice
books, if you care to read in the evening, and a
radio. And perhaps you brought your knitting?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I forgot all about that,&rdquo; replied Mary Louise.
&ldquo;But of course I do knit, and I can easily
buy some wool and some needles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Hilliard opened the door of the room
that was to be Mary Louise&rsquo;s and handed her
the key.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now I&rsquo;ll leave you to rest and unpack,&rdquo; she
said. &ldquo;Perhaps you can come down early before
dinner to meet some of the girls in the reception
room. The younger ones usually play the radio
and dance a little before dinner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be there!&rdquo; returned Mary Louise joyfully.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_38">[38]</div>
<h2 id="c3"><span class="small">CHAPTER III</span>
<br /><i>The Book Club</i></h2>
<p>Mary Louise was a little awe-struck as she sat
down alone in her new bedroom. The first time
she had ever been away from home by herself,
without any friends! Alone in a big city&mdash;working
on a job! It seemed to her that she had
suddenly grown up. She couldn&rsquo;t be the same
care-free high-school girl who had gone coasting
only yesterday afternoon with her friends.</p>
<p>A momentary sensation of depression took
hold of her as she thought of Jane and the boys
and the informal party she was missing that
evening. It would be wonderful if Jane could be
with her now, sharing her experiences as she
always had, helping her to solve this mystery.
But such a thing was impossible, of course. Jane
wouldn&rsquo;t want to give up the Christmas gayety
at Riverside, and besides, this was a real job.
You couldn&rsquo;t bring your friends along on a real
job as if it were only play.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_39">[39]</div>
<p>Then she thought of that other Riverside girl
alone in this big city. Margaret Detweiler, the
girl who had so mysteriously disappeared. What
could have happened to her? Suppose something
like that should happen to Mary Louise!</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m positively getting morbid,&rdquo; she thought,
jumping up from the chair on which she was
seated and beginning to unpack her things. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d
better get dressed and go down and meet some
of the young people. I&rsquo;ll never accomplish anything
by mooning about like this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She unpacked her suitcase and hung her
clothing in the closet. What a neat little room
it was, with its pretty maple furniture and white
ruffled curtains! So different from the common,
ugly boarding-house bedroom! She was lucky to
have such a nice place to live in. And Mrs. Hilliard
was certainly a dear.</p>
<p>She found the shower bath down the hall, and
feeling refreshed, slipped into a new wine-red
cr&ecirc;pe, which her mother had bought her especially
for the holidays. It was very becoming,
and her eyes sparkled as she ran down the steps
to the first floor. No use bothering with elevators
when she had only one flight to go.</p>
<p>Mrs. Hilliard was at the desk, talking to the
secretary, who was putting on her hat and coat.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_40">[40]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Mary Louise,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I want you to
come here and register and meet Miss Horton.
This is Miss Gay,&rdquo; she explained, &ldquo;a young
friend of mine. She is visiting me for the holidays,
and I forgot to have her register when she
came in. But as she is using room 206, and not
my apartment, I think she had better register.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary Louise nodded approvingly and wrote
her name in the book.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have never come across a girl named
Margaret Detweiler, have you, Miss Horton?&rdquo;
she asked. &ldquo;I want to find her if I can while I
am in Philadelphia.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The secretary shook her head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t think so. You might look through
the book, though. I can&rsquo;t remember all the transients
who have stopped here at Stoddard
House.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Naturally,&rdquo; agreed Mary Louise, and she
turned the pages eagerly. But of course she did
not find the name. Coincidences like that don&rsquo;t
often happen, and besides, she reasoned, if she
did find it, it wouldn&rsquo;t do her much good. That
wouldn&rsquo;t tell her where Margaret was now.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_41">[41]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Come into the music room with me,&rdquo; said
Mrs. Hilliard. &ldquo;I see one of our newest arrivals
here&mdash;a young girl who came only last week.
She can&rsquo;t be more than nineteen or twenty. I
think you&rsquo;d like each other.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl, an attractive brunette with a gay
manner and a little too much lipstick, was standing
beside the radio, turning the dials. She
looked up as Mrs. Hilliard and Mary Louise
entered the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Brooks, I want you to meet a friend of
mine&mdash;Miss Gay,&rdquo; said Mrs. Hilliard. &ldquo;Perhaps
I&rsquo;d better say &lsquo;Pauline&rsquo; and &lsquo;Mary Louise,&rsquo; because
I know you young people don&rsquo;t bother
with last names.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girls smiled at each other, and the manager
went towards the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would you be good enough to take care of
Mary Louise&mdash;introduce her to any of the other
guests who come in&mdash;Miss Brooks? I have to go
back to the desk, for the secretary has gone
home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; agreed Pauline immediately. She
turned on some dance music. &ldquo;What do you say
we dance?&rdquo; she asked Mary Louise. &ldquo;And does
everybody call you by both names?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Most people shorten it to &lsquo;Mary Lou.&rsquo; Yes,
I love to dance. That&rsquo;s a dandy fox trot.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_42">[42]</div>
<p>The girls stepped off, Pauline talking gayly
all the time, asking Mary Louise all sorts of
questions: where she was from, how long she was
going to stay, and so on. Mary Louise answered
pleasantly, happy to have found a new friend.
It wouldn&rsquo;t be so bad without Jane, now that she
had found a girl near her own age in Philadelphia,
although she thought that Pauline
was probably nearer twenty-five than twenty.
Middle-aged people like Mrs. Hilliard weren&rsquo;t
so good at guessing young people&rsquo;s ages, unless
they had children of their own.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish I could take Pauline into my confidence,&rdquo;
thought Mary Louise, &ldquo;and have her
help me the way Jane did. It would be so much
nicer.&rdquo; But she knew that would not be wise:
her father and Mrs. Hilliard wanted her to keep
her job a secret. However, she did make it a
point to ask Pauline a few questions in return
for those she had answered. Not that she was
interested in Pauline as a suspect&mdash;the girl had
only arrived last week, Mrs. Hilliard said&mdash;but
because she really wanted a young companion
while she was in this strange city.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_43">[43]</div>
<p>&ldquo;My parents are dead,&rdquo; Pauline told her. &ldquo;I
have a rich aunt who usually stays at the Ritz
when she&rsquo;s in Philadelphia, but I don&rsquo;t care
enough about her to live with her. I sort of flit
from place to place, and write fashion articles
for the magazines whenever my income runs
short. I have a pretty good time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you ever stayed at Stoddard House before?&rdquo;
asked Mary Louise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I usually avoid women&rsquo;s places like
Y. W. C. A.&rsquo;s and girls&rsquo; clubs,&rdquo; was the reply.
&ldquo;But this sort of looked different to me, and I
thought I&rsquo;d give it a try. It&rsquo;s pretty good, don&rsquo;t
you think?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I like it very much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By this time half-a-dozen people had entered
the room, and two more couples were dancing.
Suddenly Mary Louise felt bewildered. How
could she possibly get to know so many people
in the short space of two weeks and hope to find
the thief?</p>
<p>The music changed, and the other dancers
left the room. Apparently the dining-room doors
were open.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gosh, I couldn&rsquo;t introduce you to any of those
women, Mary Lou,&rdquo; said Pauline. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know
any of their names.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; agreed the young detective.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not feeling a bit lonely.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go eat&mdash;or are you supposed to wait for
Mrs. Hilliard?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_44">[44]</div>
<p>&ldquo;No, she told me not to. She&rsquo;s such a busy
person, she has to snatch her meals whenever she
can. But I&rsquo;ll be with her in the evenings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Exciting life!&rdquo; observed Pauline. &ldquo;Maybe I
can rake up a date for you later. I&rsquo;ve got one
myself for tonight, and I&rsquo;ll sound Ben out. If he
can get hold of another fellow for tomorrow
night&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t think I better make any plans,&rdquo;
interrupted Mary Louise. &ldquo;Though I do appreciate
it a lot, Pauline. But you see I am Mrs.
Hilliard&rsquo;s guest. I have to consult her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O.K.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two girls went into the dining room, an
attractive place, with tables for two and four
persons, and chose one of the smaller ones.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t want any of the old dames parking
with us,&rdquo; observed Pauline, glancing at a couple
of elderly women just entering the room. &ldquo;They
cramp my style.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rather,&rdquo; laughed Mary Louise, though she
secretly wished she might meet some of the &ldquo;old
dames,&rdquo; as Pauline called them. Any one of them
might be the thief.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_45">[45]</div>
<p>Pauline Brooks was very different from the
girls of Riverside&mdash;not nearly so refined, Mary
Louise thought&mdash;but she was a gay companion
and made witty remarks about everything. No
doubt she was a clever writer.</p>
<p>Just as the girls finished their excellent dinner,
Mrs. Hilliard came into the room. Pauline
stood up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be running along, Mary Lou,&rdquo; she said.
&ldquo;Now you have company I better leave you and
get dressed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary Louise smiled. &ldquo;Have a good time&mdash;and
I&rsquo;ll see you tomorrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not too early!&rdquo; warned Pauline. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll probably
be dancing till the small hours tonight.&rdquo;
She left the room, and Mrs. Hilliard sat down in
her place.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you stay here with me while I eat my
dinner, Mary Louise?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, indeed,&rdquo; replied the girl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And did you enjoy your dinner?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was wonderful! Just like a fine hotel.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_46">[46]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I think Stoddard House is a fine hotel&mdash;on a
small scale, of course.... And now I have a
suggestion to offer for tonight,&rdquo; she continued
as she ate her dinner. &ldquo;Some of the regular
guests here have a book club which meets once
a week. I seldom go to the meetings&mdash;I never
seem to have time&mdash;but I thought I could take
you tonight, and in that way you would get acquainted
with some of these people. Though I
don&rsquo;t suppose you&rsquo;ll find the person we&rsquo;re looking
for among them. Thieves aren&rsquo;t often book
lovers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it will help me to get the people sorted
out, and I am so at sea,&rdquo; said Mary Louise. &ldquo;I
think it is a fine idea, Mrs. Hilliard. What time
does the club meet?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seven-thirty. But we&rsquo;ll go to my room first,
and you can copy down the names of all the
guests, and their room numbers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s great!&rdquo; she cried, thankful to be
getting at something definite to start with.</p>
<p>As soon as Mrs. Hilliard finished her dinner
she and Mary Louise took the elevator to the
fourth floor and walked down the long corridor
to the back of the hotel. Here was Mrs. Hilliard&rsquo;s
own private apartment, a cozy suite of
three rooms and a bath.</p>
<p>Mary Louise settled herself comfortably in an
armchair and took out her notebook.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you want the names of the maids?&rdquo; asked
Mrs. Hilliard as she picked up some papers
from her desk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, not yet,&rdquo; replied the girl. &ldquo;You believe
in their innocence, so I think I&rsquo;d rather study the
guests first.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_47">[47]</div>
<p>Mrs. Hilliard handed her a paper, a methodical
list of the bedrooms on the second and third
floors, and Mary Louise copied it, just as it was,
into her notebook:</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_48">[48]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You have quite a lot of empty rooms, haven&rsquo;t
you, Mrs. Hilliard?&rdquo; inquired Mary Louise,
when she had finished her copy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. It&rsquo;s always dull at this time of year.
And we never are very full. After all, it&rsquo;s rather
expensive, with wages on the scale they are
now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How much do you charge?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fourteen dollars a week. But that doesn&rsquo;t
cover our expenses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m sure it doesn&rsquo;t. Everything is lovely&mdash;I
didn&rsquo;t tell you how much I like my room&mdash;and
the food couldn&rsquo;t be better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we have an income from the Stoddard
estate which helps to pay expenses,&rdquo; Mrs. Hilliard
explained.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is a woman here named Miss Henrietta
Stoddard,&rdquo; observed Mary Louise, looking
at her list. &ldquo;Is she any relation of the founder?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, she is her niece. Old Mrs. Stoddard provided
in her will that Henrietta should be allowed
to live here free all her life, as long as
she was single or a widow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How old a woman is she?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_49">[49]</div>
<p>&ldquo;About forty-five now, I should judge. And
very bitter. She expected to inherit her aunt&rsquo;s
money, and she even tried to break the will.
She hasn&rsquo;t any money&mdash;I think she does odd jobs
like taking care of children and doing hand
sewing for her spending money and her clothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hm!&rdquo; remarked Mary Louise.</p>
<p>Mrs. Hilliard smiled. &ldquo;I know what you are
thinking&mdash;and I kind of think so myself. That
Miss Stoddard is the thief. But you&rsquo;d never believe
it to look at her. She&rsquo;s prim and proper
and austere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You never can tell,&rdquo; said Mary Louise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, that&rsquo;s true.... Well, you&rsquo;ll have a
good chance to judge for yourself tonight. Miss
Stoddard is the one who is in charge of the book
club. There is a library fund in the endowment,
and these women decide upon what to buy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me which of these guests belong to the
club,&rdquo; urged the girl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All the regular residents belong, except Miss
Violet Granger. She is an artist&mdash;she draws for
magazines and for an advertising firm&mdash;and she
always keeps apart from the other guests. She is
the one from whom the oil painting and the
fifty dollars were stolen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary Louise nodded and put a check beside
Miss Granger&rsquo;s name.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_50">[50]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I ought to check the names
of all the other people who have had valuables
stolen. Who else was there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, as I told you, the hotel itself lost the
silverware and the Chinese vase. Then there
were four watches stolen&mdash;my own, Mrs. Weinberger&rsquo;s,
and the two Walder girls.... By
the way, they are lovely girls, Mary Louise&mdash;they&rsquo;ve
lived here a couple of years, and I know
their families&mdash;I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;re going to like
them....</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the final&mdash;at least, I hope it&rsquo;s the final
robbery&mdash;was the painting and the money from
Miss Granger&rsquo;s room. But I have a feeling that
isn&rsquo;t the end, and the guests are all nervous too.
It&rsquo;s hurting our business&mdash;and&mdash;making my own
job seem uncertain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary Louise closed her notebook thoughtfully
and sighed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do the best I can, Mrs. Hilliard,&rdquo; she
promised solemnly.</p>
<p>Ten minutes later they took the elevator to
the first floor, and Mrs. Hilliard led the way
into the library. It was a cheerful room with an
open fireplace, a number of comfortable chairs
and built-in bookcases around the walls.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_51">[51]</div>
<p>Miss Henrietta Stoddard, a plain-looking
woman with spectacles, sat at the table on one
side, with a pile of books and a notebook beside
her. She was talking to an elderly woman and a
younger one. Mrs. Hilliard introduced Mary
Louise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Weinberger and Miss Weinberger,&rdquo;
she said, and Mary Louise immediately placed
them as the mother and daughter who lived in
rooms 302 and 304.</p>
<p>The daughter was complaining to Miss Stoddard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see why we can&rsquo;t have some more exciting
books,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Something a little more
youthful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Stoddard drew the corners of her severe
mouth together.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We buy just what the club votes for,&rdquo; she replied
icily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because the younger members never come to
put in their votes!&rdquo; returned the younger woman
petulantly. &ldquo;I asked the Walder girls to come
to the meeting tonight, but of course they had
dates.&rdquo; She turned eagerly to Mary Louise. &ldquo;You
can put in a vote, Miss Gay!&rdquo; she exclaimed.
&ldquo;Will you suggest something youthful?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_52">[52]</div>
<p>Mary Louise smiled. &ldquo;I shan&rsquo;t be here long
enough to belong to the club,&rdquo; she answered.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m just visiting Mrs. Hilliard for the vacation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a schoolgirl?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. A junior at Riverside High School.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never heard of it,&rdquo; returned Miss Weinberger,
abruptly and scornfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid it&rsquo;s not famous&mdash;like Yale or Harvard,&rdquo;
remarked Mary Louise, with a sly smile.</p>
<p>Miss Weinberger went on talking to the
others in her complaining, whining tone. Mary
Louise disliked her intensely, but she didn&rsquo;t believe
she would ever steal anything.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What time is it?&rdquo; demanded Miss Stoddard
sharply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. My watch was stolen, you
know,&rdquo; replied Mrs. Weinberger, looking accusingly
at Mrs. Hilliard, as if it were her fault.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You never heard anything about those
watches, did you?&rdquo; inquired Miss Stoddard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied the manager, keeping her eyes
away from Mary Louise. &ldquo;There was a night
watchman that night, but he said he didn&rsquo;t see
any burglar or hear any disturbance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The night watchman couldn&rsquo;t watch four
watches,&rdquo; Mary Louise remarked facetiously.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_53">[53]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, there were four stolen,&rdquo; agreed Mrs.
Weinberger. &ldquo;I suppose Mrs. Hilliard told
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary Louise flushed: she must be more careful
in the future.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think that bleached-blond chorus girl took
them,&rdquo; observed Miss Weinberger. &ldquo;She was
here then and left the next day. That name of
hers was probably assumed. &lsquo;Mary Green!&rsquo; Too
common!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary Louise wanted to write this in her notebook,
but caution bade her wait till the meeting
was over.</p>
<p>The door opened, and an old lady came in,
leaning on her cane. She was past eighty, but
very bright and cheerful, with beautiful gray
hair and a charming smile.</p>
<p>Mrs. Hilliard sprang up and offered her the
best chair in the room and introduced Mary
Louise to her. Her name was Mrs. Moyer.</p>
<p>Now the meeting began: the guests returned
the books they had borrowed and discussed new
ones to purchase. At half-past nine a maid
brought in tea and cakes, and the evening ended
sociably.</p>
<p>Thankful to slip off alone to write her observations
in her notebook, Mary Louise went
to her own room.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_54">[54]</div>
<h2 id="c4"><span class="small">CHAPTER IV</span>
<br /><i>A Midnight Visitor</i></h2>
<p>Mary Louise put on her kimono and stretched
herself out comfortably on her pretty bed, with
her notebook in her hands. What a lovely room
it was! What a charming little bedside table,
with its silk-shaded lamp, its dainty ice-water
jug&mdash;and its telephone. For that convenience especially
she was thankful: she&rsquo;d far rather have
a telephone than a radio. Little did she realize
how soon she was to find that instrument so useful!</p>
<p>She opened her notebook at the page upon
which she had written the guests&rsquo; names, and
counted them. Fourteen people besides herself,
and of that number she had met only five. Rather
a slow beginning!</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I only had Jane here, she&rsquo;d know everybody
in the place by now,&rdquo; she thought wistfully.
&ldquo;Jane is clever, but she does jump at conclusions.
Maybe I&rsquo;m better off alone.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_55">[55]</div>
<p>She glanced at the notebook again and resolved
not to bother yet with the names of people
she hadn&rsquo;t met. She&rsquo;d concentrate instead upon
the five that she did know. She began at the
beginning with the girl with whom she had
danced and eaten supper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pauline Brooks couldn&rsquo;t be guilty,&rdquo; she decided.
&ldquo;Because she came to Stoddard House
only a few days ago for the first time. After the
first two robberies had taken place. So she&rsquo;s
out....</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now I&rsquo;m not so sure about Miss Henrietta
Stoddard. She might even believe she had a right
to steal things, because she was cheated out of
her inheritance. Yes&mdash;I&rsquo;ll watch Miss Stoddard
carefully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Next those two Weinberger women. Hardly
possible, when the mother lost her own watch.
Of course, thieves sometimes pretend to have
things stolen, just to establish their innocence,
the same way murderers often wound themselves&mdash;for
alibis. But, just the same, I believe
those women are honest. They&rsquo;re pretty well
off, too, to judge from their clothes and their
jewelry.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_56">[56]</div>
<p>She came to the last person she had met&mdash;the
old lady who had come to the book-club meeting
with a cane&mdash;Mrs. Moyer. Mary Louise&rsquo;s
face broke into a smile. Nobody in her right
senses could suspect a person like that!</p>
<p>That was all. Except the secretary, Miss Horton,
whom she had met at the desk.</p>
<p>Mary Louise closed the notebook and put it
on the table beside her. That was enough for
tonight; now she&rsquo;d try to get some sleep. She put
out the light and opened the window. Snow still
covered everything except the streets and the
sidewalks, and the moon shone over the roofs
of the buildings beyond. Right below her side
window was a fire escape, which made her feel
somehow safe and secure.</p>
<p>It was not nearly so quiet here as in Riverside;
automobile horns honked now and again,
and the sound of trolleys from the street in front
was plainly heard. But Mary Louise was not
worried about the noise, and a few minutes after
she was in bed she was sound asleep.</p>
<p>How many hours later she was awakened by a
dream about Margaret Detweiler, Mary Louise
had no way of knowing, for she had left her
watch on the bureau. She thought she had found
Margaret alone in an empty house, cold and
starving to death, and she was trying to remember
just what principles of first aid to apply,
when she awoke and found it was only a dream.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_57">[57]</div>
<p>But something, she realized instantly, had
awakened her. Something&mdash;somebody&mdash;was in
her room!</p>
<p>Her first sensation was one of terror. A ghost&mdash;no,
a gypsy, perhaps&mdash;who would clap a gag
over her mouth and bind her hand and foot!
But before she uttered a sound she remembered
where she was and why she was there. A delirious
feeling of triumph stole over her, making
her believe that success was at hand for her in
her sleuthing. If this person were really the
Stoddard House sneak thief, Mary Louise could
lie still and watch her, for the room was light
enough from the moon and the street lamps to
show up the intruder quite plainly.</p>
<p>Ever so cautiously, without turning her head
or making any kind of sound, she rolled her eyes
toward her bureau, where she could sense the
intruder to be. Her reward was immediate: she
saw a short person in dark clothing standing
there, carefully picking up some object.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My purse&mdash;and my watch!&rdquo; Mary Louise
thought grimly. The little engraved watch her
father had given her last Christmas.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_58">[58]</div>
<p>The figure turned around and silently crept
towards the door. But sudden, swift dismay took
possession of Mary Louise, making her tremble
with fear and disappointment. The thief was not
a woman, whom she could hope to identify as a
guest at Stoddard House. He was a man!</p>
<p>He turned the key in the lock so quietly that
only the tiniest click could be heard. Then, just
as softly, he closed the door again and vanished
into the hall.</p>
<p>Mary Louise gasped audibly with both relief
and disappointment. Relief that he was gone,
disappointment that he was a common, ordinary
burglar whom she could not hope to catch.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, she meant to do what she could,
so she turned on her light and reached for the
telephone beside her bed. In another moment she
had told her story to the police, and, so perfect
were their radio signals, in less than five minutes
one of their cars stood at the door of the hotel.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Mary Louise had hastily thrown
on a few clothes and run down the stairs to warn
the night watchman.</p>
<p>The halls were lighted all night, as well as
the lobby of the hotel; she did not see how the
burglar could escape without attracting the
watchman&rsquo;s notice.</p>
<p>She found him quietly smoking a pipe on the
doorstep. He said he had seen nobody.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_59">[59]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I think the burglar came in through the
window from the fire escape,&rdquo; Mary Louise said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t see how he could,&rdquo; returned the man.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been around there at the side for the last
half hour. Nobody came along that alley.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Baffled, Mary Louise summoned Mrs. Hilliard
on the house phone, and by the time she
stepped out of the elevator the two policemen
had arrived.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The thief must be hiding somewhere in the
building,&rdquo; concluded Mary Louise. &ldquo;Waiting
for a chance to slip away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to make a search,&rdquo; announced
Mrs. Hilliard. &ldquo;You guard the doorway and the
stairway, Mike,&rdquo; she said to the watchman, &ldquo;and
one of you officers go around the first floor and
see whether the windows are all securely locked&mdash;in
case the burglar escaped through one of
them. Then the other officer can come with Miss
Gay and me while we search the floors above.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Immediately the plan was put into effect, and
the searchers began on the second floor, looking
first in the corridors and closets and empty
rooms, then knocking at the doors of the guests&rsquo;
rooms.</p>
<p>Pauline Brooks&rsquo; door was the first they went
to, and here a light shone under the cracks.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_60">[60]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Sorry to disturb you, Miss Brooks,&rdquo; called
Mrs. Hilliard, &ldquo;but a sneak thief has gotten into
the hotel, and we want to find him. May we
come in?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just a minute,&rdquo; replied the girl. &ldquo;Till I put
on my bath robe. I was out late&mdash;at a dance, and
I&rsquo;m just undressing now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What time is it, anyway?&rdquo; asked Mary Louise.
&ldquo;You see, my watch was stolen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s only a few minutes after one,&rdquo; replied the
policeman.</p>
<p>A moment later Pauline unlocked the door,
and the three people entered. The room was very
untidy: clothing had been flung about everywhere,
and two open suitcases occupied the
chairs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look in the closet,&rdquo; advised Mrs. Hilliard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s nobody there,&rdquo; answered Pauline.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve just been in it. But you might look under
the bed. That&rsquo;s where men always hide in the
bedroom farces.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t think this was a &lsquo;bedroom
farce&rsquo; if you&rsquo;d just lost your watch and your
purse,&rdquo; remarked Mary Louise sharply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, Mary Lou,&rdquo; apologized Pauline.
&ldquo;You see, I didn&rsquo;t know that <i>you</i> were the victim.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_61">[61]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got to get along,&rdquo; interrupted the officer.
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s nobody here&mdash;I&rsquo;m sure of that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They passed on to the other rooms, waking up
the guests when it was necessary, apologizing,
explaining&mdash;and finding nobody. In only two of
the rooms besides Pauline&rsquo;s had they found
lights burning. Miss Granger, the artist, was
still working on some drawings she was making
for a magazine, and Miss Henrietta Stoddard,
who explained that she was &ldquo;such a poor
sleeper,&rdquo; was reading a book. But both these
women said that they had heard no disturbance.</p>
<p>When the search was completed and the group
returned to the first floor of the hotel, the watchman
and the officer had nothing to report. The
windows on the ground floor were all securely
locked, the latter announced, and the former said
that no one had escaped by the front door or the
fire escape.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s either an inside job or your young friend
dreamed it,&rdquo; one of the policemen said to Mrs.
Hilliard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It couldn&rsquo;t be an inside job,&rdquo; returned the
manager. &ldquo;For there isn&rsquo;t any man who lives in
the hotel.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_62">[62]</div>
<p>&ldquo;And I didn&rsquo;t dream it,&rdquo; protested Mary Louise.
&ldquo;Because my watch and my purse are gone,
and my door was unlocked. I locked it myself
when I went to bed last night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;ll keep an eye on the building all
night,&rdquo; promised the policeman as he opened the
door. &ldquo;Let us know if you have any more trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the men had gone, Mrs. Hilliard persuaded
Mary Louise to come to her apartment
for the rest of the night. She had a couch-bed in
her sitting room which she often used for her
own guests.</p>
<p>Mary Louise agreed, but it was a long while
before she fell asleep again. She kept listening
for sounds, imagining she heard footsteps in the
hall, or windows opening somewhere in the
building. But at last she dozed off, and slept
until Mrs. Hilliard&rsquo;s alarm awakened her the
next morning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You had better go down to the dining room
for your breakfast, Mary Louise,&rdquo; said the manager.
&ldquo;I just have orange juice and coffee, up
here&mdash;if I go into the dining room I am tempted
to overeat, and I put on weight.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_63">[63]</div>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; agreed Mary Louise. &ldquo;I want to
go to my room for fresh clothing anyway&mdash;I just
grabbed these things last night in a hurry....
Mrs. Hilliard, what do you think of last night&rsquo;s
occurrence?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what to think. I was convinced
that all our robberies before this were inside
jobs, because our watchman was so careful. But
now I don&rsquo;t know. Of course, this may be something
entirely different. We&rsquo;ll see if anything
happens tonight. You&rsquo;re sure it was a man, Mary
Louise?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Positive. He wore a cap pulled down over
his head, and a mask over his eyes. He had on a
dark suit&mdash;sneakers, too, for I couldn&rsquo;t hear him
walk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did he have a gun?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, because I pretended to be
asleep, so he didn&rsquo;t need to defend himself. He
got out so quickly. Where could he have vanished
to?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Hilliard shook her head with a sigh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t the slightest idea,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, he might have had an accomplice,&rdquo;
mused Mary Louise. &ldquo;Some woman may
have let him out her window to the fire escape.
Still, the watchman was keeping his eye on that....&rdquo;
Mary Louise&rsquo;s tone became dreary. &ldquo;I
guess I&rsquo;m not much use to you, Mrs. Hilliard. I
don&rsquo;t think I ought to take the salary.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_64">[64]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You mean you want to go home, Mary Louise?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh no! I wouldn&rsquo;t leave now for anything.
But I mean I probably shan&rsquo;t be any help in
finding a thief like that. So I oughtn&rsquo;t to accept
any pay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry about that,&rdquo; returned Mrs. Hilliard,
patting Mary Louise&rsquo;s arm affectionately.
&ldquo;You just do the best you can. Nobody can do
more. I&rsquo;d really like it proved that none of our
guests is the thief. I&rsquo;d much rather find out that
it was a common burglar.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Reassured, Mary Louise went to her own
room and dressed. By the time she reached the
dining room the guests who held positions had
already eaten their breakfasts and gone, and the
others, who had nothing to do all day, had not
yet put in an appearance. It was only a little
after eight, but the dining room was deserted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish I had somebody to talk to,&rdquo; she
thought sadly as she seated herself at a little table
by a window. The sunlight streamed in through
the dainty ruffled curtains, there were rosebuds
in the center of her table, and a menu from
which she could order anything she wanted, but
Mary Louise was not happy. She felt baffled and
lonely.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_65">[65]</div>
<p>She ordered grapefruit first, and just as she
finished it, Mrs. Weinberger came into the room.
She made her way straight to Mary Louise&rsquo;s
table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;May I sit with you, Miss Gay?&rdquo; she asked.
&ldquo;My daughter won&rsquo;t eat breakfast for fear of
gaining a pound, and it&rsquo;s so lonesome eating all
by yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary Louise smiled cordially.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think so too, Mrs. Weinberger,&rdquo; she replied.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be delighted to have you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you feel nervous after last night? It must
have been terrible to be right in the room when
the burglar got in. I was away when my watch
was stolen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me about it, Mrs. Weinberger,&rdquo; urged
Mary Louise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was over in Mrs. Moyer&rsquo;s room,&rdquo; the
woman explained, after she had given her order
to the waitress, &ldquo;and my daughter went out of
my room and couldn&rsquo;t remember whether she
locked the door or not. Anyway, I discovered
that my watch was gone when I was dressing for
dinner.&rdquo; She sighed. &ldquo;It was very valuable&mdash;a
present from my late husband.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary Louise had an inspiration.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_66">[66]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I believe I&rsquo;ll visit some pawnshops today, to
ask about mine,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and I can inquire
about yours at the same time, if you want me to,
Mrs. Weinberger.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, indeed! But I am afraid it is too late
now. Mine was an old-fashioned watch&mdash;we
used to wear them pinned on our dresses, with a
brooch. Mine had seven diamonds on it in front,
and my initials &lsquo;E. W.&rsquo; in tiny pearls on the
back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you advertise?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, of course. But nothing came of it. My
daughter thinks that transient guest&mdash;a chorus
girl named Mary Green&mdash;stole it. We tried to
trace her, but we couldn&rsquo;t find her name with
any of the theatrical companies in town at the
time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She never came back here to Stoddard
House?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh no.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And were the other watches stolen the same
day?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. Mrs. Hilliard&rsquo;s was taken during the
supper hour, but she had laid it down on the
desk, so that was her own carelessness. But the
Walder girls had theirs taken while they were
asleep&mdash;just as yours was.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What were theirs like?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_67">[67]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Plain gold wrist-watches, with their initials&mdash;R. W.
and E. W. Their names are Ruth and
Evelyn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll do what I can,&rdquo; concluded Mary
Louise. &ldquo;And now let&rsquo;s talk about something
pleasant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So for the rest of the meal she and Mrs. Weinberger
discussed books and the current moving
pictures.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_68">[68]</div>
<h2 id="c5"><span class="small">CHAPTER V</span>
<br /><i>Another Robbery</i></h2>
<p>Mary Louise had three separate plans in view
for the morning. First, she would visit as many
pawnshops as possible in the vicinity and ask to
see their displays of watches. Second, she meant
to go to Strawbridge and Clothier&rsquo;s department
store and find out whether Margaret Detweiler
had worked there, and why and when she had
left. And third, she wanted to find some pretext
to call on Miss Henrietta Stoddard in her own
room and observe her closely.</p>
<p>As she walked out of the dining room she met
Mrs. Hilliard going towards her little office on
the first floor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Could I see you for a moment, Mrs. Hilliard?&rdquo;
she inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly, my dear. Come into the office with
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary Louise followed her into the room, but
she did not sit down. She knew how busy the
hotel manager would be on Saturday morning.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_69">[69]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I have decided to visit some pawnshops, Mrs.
Hilliard,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I have my own watch to
identify, and I got a pretty good description of
Mrs. Weinberger&rsquo;s today. But I want you to tell
me a little more about the other things that were
stolen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The silverware had an ivy-leaf pattern, and
the initials &lsquo;S. H.&rsquo;&mdash;for Stoddard House&mdash;engraved
on it,&rdquo; replied the woman. &ldquo;The vase was
an old Chinese one, of an odd size, with decorations
in that peculiar red they so often use. I
believe I can draw it better than I can describe
it. But I feel sure you&rsquo;d never find it in a pawnshop.
Whoever stole that sold it to an antique
dealer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>However, she picked up her pencil and
roughly sketched the vase for Mary Louise, giving
her a good idea of its appearance. At the
same time she described the painting which had
been stolen from Miss Granger&rsquo;s room&mdash;an
original by the American artist Whistler.</p>
<p>Mary Louise wrote all these facts in her notebook
and kept the drawing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s fine, Mrs. Hilliard,&rdquo; she said as she
opened the door. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going out now, and I&rsquo;ll
be back for lunch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good-bye and good luck!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_70">[70]</div>
<p>Mary Louise went to her room, and from the
telephone book beside her bed she listed the addresses
of all the pawnshops in the neighborhood.
This was going to be fun, she thought&mdash;at
least, if she didn&rsquo;t lose her nerve.</p>
<p>She hesitated for a few minutes outside of the
first shop she came to. The iron bars guarding
the window, the three balls in the doorway,
seemed rather forbidding. For Mary Louise had
never been inside a pawnshop.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can say I want to buy a watch,&rdquo; she thought.
&ldquo;I do, too&mdash;I certainly need one. But I&rsquo;m afraid
I&rsquo;d rather have a brand-new Ingersoll than a
gold one that has belonged to somebody else.
Still, I don&rsquo;t have to tell the shopkeeper that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Boldly she opened the door and went in.</p>
<p>She had expected to find an old man with
spectacles and a skullcap, the typical pawnbroker
one sees in the moving pictures. But there
was nothing different about this man behind the
counter from any ordinary storekeeper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good-morning, miss,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;What can I
do for you today?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to look at ladies&rsquo; watches,&rdquo; replied
Mary Louise steadily.</p>
<p>The man nodded and indicated a glass case on
the opposite side of the shop. Mary Louise examined
its contents intently.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_71">[71]</div>
<p>&ldquo;The fact is,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;my own watch was
stolen. I thought maybe it might have been
pawned, and I&rsquo;d look around in the shops first,
before I buy one, in the hope of finding it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Recently?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. Last night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man smiled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If it had been pawned last night or this
morning, you wouldn&rsquo;t find it offered for sale
yet. We have to hold all valuables until the time
on their tickets expires.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, of course! How stupid of me....
Well, could you tell me whether any ladies&rsquo;
watches have been pawned here since midnight
last night?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, we&rsquo;ve taken in two,&rdquo; replied the man
graciously. &ldquo;And I don&rsquo;t mind showing them to
you. I&rsquo;m not in league with any thieves. I&rsquo;m an
honest man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure of it,&rdquo; agreed Mary Louise instantly.</p>
<p>But she was disappointed upon sight of the
watches. Neither of them was hers, nor did
either remotely resemble Mrs. Weinberger&rsquo;s or
any of the other three stolen from Stoddard
House.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_72">[72]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you ever so much,&rdquo; she said finally.
&ldquo;I think I&rsquo;ll look around a little more and ask
about my own, and if I can&rsquo;t find it, I may come
back and buy one of yours. Several of those you
have are very pretty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thoroughly satisfied with her interview, she
walked down the street until she came to another
shop. It was on the corner of an alley, and just
as she approached the intersection she noticed a
woman in an old-fashioned brown suit coming
out of the side door of the pawnshop. The
woman glanced about furtively, as if she did not
care to be seen, and caught Mary Louise&rsquo;s eyes.
With a gasp of surprise, the girl recognized her
immediately. It was Miss Henrietta Stoddard!</p>
<p>Before Mary Louise could even nod to her,
the woman had slipped across the street and
around the corner, lost amid the Saturday morning
crowd that was thronging the busy street.
Mary Louise repressed a smile and entered the
pawnshop by the front door.</p>
<p>She repeated her former experience, with this
difference, however: she did not find the shopkeeper
nearly so cordial or so willing to co-operate.
Finally she asked point-blank what the
woman in the brown suit had just pawned.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_73">[73]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t see that that&rsquo;s any of your business,
miss,&rdquo; he replied disagreeably. &ldquo;But I will tell
you that it wasn&rsquo;t a watch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary Louise wasn&rsquo;t sure that she believed
him. But there was nothing that she could do
without enlisting the help of her father.</p>
<p>She visited four other shops without any success,
and finally decided to abandon the plan. It
was too hopeless, too hit-or-miss, to expect to
find those watches by that kind of searching. Far
better, she concluded, to concentrate on observing
the actions of the people at Stoddard House.
Especially Miss Henrietta Stoddard herself!</p>
<p>So she turned her steps to the big department
store where she believed Margaret Detweiler
had worked till last Christmas and inquired her
way to the employment office. The store was
brilliantly decorated for Christmas, and crowds
of late shoppers filled the aisles and the elevators,
so that it was not easy to reach her destination.</p>
<p>Nor was the employment manager&rsquo;s office
empty. Even at this late date, applicants were
evidently hoping for jobs, and Mary Louise had
to sit down and wait her turn. It was half an
hour later that she found herself opposite the
manager&rsquo;s desk.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_74">[74]</div>
<p>Mechanically a clerk handed her an application
to fill out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want a position,&rdquo; Mary Louise said
immediately. &ldquo;I want to see whether I can get
any information about a girl named Margaret
Detweiler who, I think, worked in your store up
to last Christmas. Would it be too much trouble
to look her up in your files? I know you&rsquo;re
busy&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; replied the manager
pleasantly, and she repeated the name to the
clerk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see,&rdquo; explained Mary Louise, &ldquo;Margaret
Detweiler&rsquo;s grandparents haven&rsquo;t heard
from her for a year, and they&rsquo;re dreadfully worried.
Margaret is all they have in the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The clerk found the card immediately.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Detweiler did work here for six months
last year,&rdquo; she stated. &ldquo;In the jewelry department.
And then she was dismissed for stealing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stealing!&rdquo; repeated Mary Louise, aghast at
such news. &ldquo;Why, I can&rsquo;t believe it! Margaret
was the most upright, honest girl at home; she
came from the best people. How did it happen?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_75">[75]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I remember her now,&rdquo; announced the employment
manager. &ldquo;A pretty, dark-eyed girl
who always dressed rather plainly. Yes, I was
surprised too. But she had been ill, I believe,
and perhaps she wasn&rsquo;t quite herself. Maybe she
had doctor&rsquo;s bills and so on. It was too bad, for
if she had come to me I could have helped her
out with a loan.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was she sent to prison?&rdquo; asked Mary Louise
in a hoarse whisper. Oh, the disgrace of the
thing! It would kill old Mrs. Detweiler if she
ever found it out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, she wasn&rsquo;t. We found the stolen article
in Miss Detweiler&rsquo;s shoe. At least, one of the
things she took&mdash;a link bracelet. We didn&rsquo;t
recover the ring, but a wealthy woman, a customer
who happened to be in the jewelry department
at the time, evidently felt sorry for Miss
Detweiler and offered to pay for the ring. We
didn&rsquo;t let her, but of course we had to dismiss
the girl.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t any idea where Margaret went&mdash;or
what she did?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only that this woman&mdash;her name was Mrs.
Ferguson, I remember, and she lived at the
Benjamin Franklin Hotel&mdash;promised Miss Detweiler
a job. So perhaps everything is all right
now.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_76">[76]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I hope so!&rdquo; exclaimed Mary Louise fervently.
And thanking the woman profusely she
left the office and the store.</p>
<p>But she had her misgivings. If everything had
turned out all right, why hadn&rsquo;t Margaret written
to her grandparents? Who was this Mrs.
Ferguson, and why had she done this kindness
for an unknown girl? Mary Louise meant to
find out, if she could.</p>
<p>She inquired her way to the Benjamin Franklin
Hotel and asked at the desk for Mrs. Ferguson.
But she was informed that no such person
lived there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would you have last year&rsquo;s register?&rdquo; she
asked timidly. She hated to put everybody to so
much trouble.</p>
<p>The clerk smiled: nobody could resist Mary
Louise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get it for you,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>After a good deal of searching she found a
Mrs. H. R. Ferguson registered at the hotel on
the twenty-third of the previous December, with
only the indefinite address of Chicago, Illinois,
after her name. Margaret Detweiler did not appear
in the book at all: evidently she had never
stayed at the Benjamin Franklin Hotel.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_77">[77]</div>
<p>With a sigh of disappointment, Mary Louise
thanked the clerk and left. Nothing had been
gained by that visit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It must be lunch time,&rdquo; she decided, after
glancing in vain at her wrist, where she was accustomed
to wear her watch. &ldquo;I guess I&rsquo;ll go
back to the house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The minute she entered the door of Stoddard
House, the most terrible commotion greeted her.
A woman&rsquo;s shriek rang through the air; someone
cried out, &ldquo;Catch her&mdash;she&rsquo;s fainted!&rdquo; the elevator
doors slammed, and people appeared from
everywhere, in wild confusion.</p>
<p>Mary Louise dashed through the door to the
desk just in time to see Mrs. Macgregor, the
wealthy widow who lived in room 201, drop
down on the bench beside the elevator. Women
pressed all around her prostrate figure: guests,
maids, Mrs. Hilliard, and the secretary, Miss
Horton, who offered a glass of water to the unconscious
woman. But nobody seemed to know
what it was all about.</p>
<p>Presently Mrs. Macgregor opened her eyes
and accepted a sip of the water. Then she glared
accusingly at Mrs. Hilliard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been robbed!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;Five hundred
dollars and a pair of diamond earrings!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_78">[78]</div>
<h2 id="c6"><span class="small">CHAPTER VI</span>
<br /><i>Saturday Afternoon</i></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Do you feel any better now, Mrs. Macgregor?&rdquo;
inquired Mrs. Hilliard, as the stricken
woman sat upright on the bench.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better!&rdquo; she repeated angrily. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll never feel
better till I get my money back again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary Louise repressed a smile. Macgregor
was a Scotch name.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, tell us how it happened,&rdquo; urged Mrs.
Hilliard. &ldquo;When did you first miss the money?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just a few minutes ago, when I came out of
my bath.&rdquo; She became hysterical again. &ldquo;Lock
the doors!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;Search everybody! Call
the police!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary Louise caught Mrs. Hilliard&rsquo;s eye.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shall I?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>Mrs. Hilliard nodded. &ldquo;And tell the janitor
to lock the doors and station himself at the front
to let the guests in who come home, for the girls
will be coming into lunch from work. Today&rsquo;s
a half holiday.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_79">[79]</div>
<p>By the time Mary Louise had returned, she
found the crowd somewhat dispersed. The servants
had gone back to their work, but several new
arrivals had joined Mrs. Hilliard and Mrs.
Macgregor. The two Walder girls, about whom
Mary Louise had heard so much, were there,
and Mrs. Hilliard introduced them. They were
both very attractive, very much the same type as
Mary Louise&rsquo;s own friends in Riverside. Much
more real, she thought, than Pauline Brooks,
with her vivid make-up and her boastful talk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is a great deal of money to keep in your
room, Mrs. Macgregor,&rdquo; Evelyn Walder said.
&ldquo;Especially after all the robberies we&rsquo;ve been
having at Stoddard House.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just it! It was on account of these
terrible goings-on that I took the money and the
diamonds from a little safe I have and got them
ready to put into the bank. Somebody was too
quick for me. But I&rsquo;m pretty sure I know who
it was: Ida, the chambermaid!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no!&rdquo; protested Mrs. Hilliard. &ldquo;Ida has
been with me two years, and I know she&rsquo;s honest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Send for her,&rdquo; commanded Mrs. Macgregor.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_80">[80]</div>
<p>While they were waiting for the girl to appear,
Mrs. Macgregor explained more calmly
just what had happened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had the money and the diamonds in a bag
on my bureau,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I was running the
water in my bathroom when I heard a knock
at the door. I unlocked it, and Ida came in with
clean towels and a fresh bureau cover. While she
was fixing the bureau cover, I hurried back to
the bathroom, put the towels away, and turned
off the water. My bath salts fell out of the closet
when I opened the door to put the towels away,
so I was delayed two or three minutes gathering
them up. I heard Ida go out and close the door
behind her, and I got into my bath. When I
came back into the bedroom, my bag was gone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you didn&rsquo;t scream immediately,&rdquo; observed
Mrs. Hilliard. &ldquo;You must have waited to
dress.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had dressed in the bathroom, before I knew
the bag was stolen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wasn&rsquo;t anybody else in your room all morning,
Mrs. Macgregor?&rdquo; Mary Louise couldn&rsquo;t
help asking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only Miss Stoddard. She had gone out to
buy me some thread&mdash;she does my mending for
me&mdash;and she stopped in on her return from the
store and took some of my lingerie to her room.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_81">[81]</div>
<p>At this moment the chambermaid, a girl of
about twenty-two, approached the group. Either
she knew nothing about the robbery, or else she
was a splendid actress, for she appeared entirely
unconcerned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You wanted me, Mrs. Hilliard?&rdquo; she inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen to the innocent baby!&rdquo; mocked Mrs.
Macgregor scornfully.</p>
<p>Ida looked puzzled, and Mrs. Hilliard briefly
explained the situation. The girl denied the
whole thing immediately.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There wasn&rsquo;t any bag on the bureau, Mrs.
Macgregor,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I know, because I
changed the cover.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe it wasn&rsquo;t on the bureau,&rdquo; admitted
Mrs. Macgregor. &ldquo;But it was somewhere in the
room. You&rsquo;re going to be searched!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl looked imploringly at Mrs. Hilliard,
but the latter could not refuse to grant Mrs.
Macgregor&rsquo;s demand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can prove I didn&rsquo;t take any bag,&rdquo; said Ida.
&ldquo;By Miss Brooks. I went right into her room
next and made her bed. She can tell you I did.
She was just going out&mdash;I&rsquo;m sure she&rsquo;ll remember.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is Miss Brooks here?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_82">[82]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I think she left the hotel about fifteen minutes
ago,&rdquo; stated Miss Horton, the secretary.
&ldquo;Before Mrs. Macgregor screamed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we can ask her when she comes back,&rdquo;
said Mrs. Hilliard. &ldquo;Where were you, Ida,
when I sent for you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Still in Miss Brooks&rsquo; room,&rdquo; replied the girl
tearfully. &ldquo;I was running the vacuum cleaner,
so I never heard the disturbance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Hilliard turned to Mrs. Macgregor. &ldquo;If
Ida did steal your bag,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;she would
have to have it concealed on her person. Mary
Louise, you take Ida to my apartment and have
her undress and prove that she isn&rsquo;t hiding anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Without a word the two girls did as they were
told and took the elevator to the fourth floor.
Mary Louise felt dreadfully sorry for her companion,
who by this time was shaking and sobbing.
She put her arm through Ida&rsquo;s as they
entered Mrs. Hilliard&rsquo;s apartment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know, Ida,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;if you did do this
it would be lots easier for you if you&rsquo;d own up
now. The police are bound to find out anyhow,
sooner or later.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_83">[83]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But I didn&rsquo;t, miss!&rdquo; protested the other girl.
&ldquo;I never stole anything in my life. I was brought
up different. I&rsquo;m a good girl, and my mother
would die if she knew I was even accused of
stealing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Instinctively Mary Louise believed her.
Nevertheless, she had to do as she was told, and
she carefully made the search. But she found
nothing.</p>
<p>Satisfied, she took the girl back to Mrs. Hilliard.
The police had already arrived, and more
of the hotel guests had returned. Miss Stoddard
was sitting beside Mrs. Macgregor, and Mary
Louise longed to suggest that she&mdash;or rather her
room&mdash;be searched.</p>
<p>However, the police attended to that. One
officer took each floor, and everybody&rsquo;s room was
systematically gone through. But the valuable
bag could not be found.</p>
<p>The doors of the hotel were unlocked, and
everybody was allowed to go in and out again
as she pleased. Mary Louise watched eagerly
for Pauline Brooks, hoping that she would prove
Ida&rsquo;s alibi, but Miss Brooks did not return. Undoubtedly
she had a date somewhere&mdash;a lively
girl like Pauline could not imagine wasting her
Saturday afternoon on &ldquo;females,&rdquo; as she would
call the guests at Stoddard House.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_84">[84]</div>
<p>The dining-room doors were thrown open,
and Mary Louise and Mrs. Hilliard went in to
their lunch together. The older woman seemed
dreadfully depressed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Macgregor is leaving this afternoon,&rdquo;
she said. &ldquo;And the Weinbergers go tomorrow.
If this keeps up, the hotel will be empty in another
week.... And I&rsquo;ll lose my position.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I hope not,&rdquo; replied Mary Louise.
&ldquo;Everybody can&rsquo;t leave because things are stolen,
for there are robberies everywhere. The big
hotels all employ private detectives, and yet I&rsquo;ve
read that an awful lot of things are taken just the
same. Some people make their living just by
robbing hotel guests. So, no matter where people
go, they run a risk. Even in homes of their own.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s true. But Stoddard House has
been particularly unlucky, and you know things
like this get around.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to do my best to find out who is
the guilty person,&rdquo; Mary Louise assured her.
&ldquo;And this morning&rsquo;s robbery ought to narrow
down my suspects to those who were at the house
at the time. At least, if you can help me by telling
me who they are.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_85">[85]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I think I can. Besides Mrs. Macgregor
and myself, there were only Miss Stoddard, the
two Weinbergers, Mrs. Moyer, and Miss
Brooks. All the rest of the guests have positions
and were away at work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary Louise took her notebook and checked
off the list.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That does make it easier, unless one of the
help is guilty. They were all here at the time.... But
of course the thief may be that same
man who stole my watch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s possible, especially if he is an accomplice
of one of the guests&mdash;of Miss Stoddard,
for instance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. I&rsquo;ve been thinking about her. She was
in Mrs. Macgregor&rsquo;s room, you know.&rdquo; But
Mary Louise did not tell Mrs. Hilliard about
seeing Miss Stoddard sneaking out of the pawnshop.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You better go to a movie this afternoon,
Mary Louise, and forget all about it for the
time being,&rdquo; advised the manager. &ldquo;Shan&rsquo;t I ask
the Walder girls to take you along? They usually
go to a show.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, thanks, Mrs. Hilliard. It&rsquo;s very thoughtful
of you, but I want to go back to the department
store and make another inquiry about the
lost girl I&rsquo;m trying to trace. I&rsquo;d like a chance
to talk to Miss Stoddard too, and to Pauline
Brooks when she comes back. Maybe she saw the
thief, if she came out of her room when Ida said
she did.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_86">[86]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, do as you like. Only don&rsquo;t worry too
much, dear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary Louise finished her lunch and went out
into the open air again. Now that she was becoming
a little more familiar with the city, she
thought she would like to walk along Chestnut
and Walnut streets, to have a look at the big
hotels and the expensive shops. The downtown
district was thronged with people, shopping,
going to matin&eacute;es, hurrying home for their weekend
holiday; the confusion was overwhelming
after the quiet of Riverside. But Mary Louise
enjoyed the excitement: it would be something
to write home about.</p>
<p>At Broad and Walnut streets she stopped to
admire the Ritz Hotel, a tall, imposing building
of white stone, where Pauline Brooks had said
that her aunt usually stayed when she was visiting
Philadelphia. What fun it would be to have
luncheon or tea there some day! If only she had
somebody to go with. Perhaps Pauline would
take her, if she asked her. Mary Louise wanted
to be able to tell the Riverside girls about it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_87">[87]</div>
<p>Half a block farther on she saw Pauline herself
coming towards her, accompanied by a
stout, stylishly dressed woman and a very blond
girl of her own age.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That must be Pauline&rsquo;s aunt,&rdquo; Mary Louise
thought, noticing what a hard, unpleasant face
the woman had, how unattractive she was, in
spite of her elegant clothes. &ldquo;No wonder Pauline
doesn&rsquo;t want to live with her!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello, Pauline!&rdquo; she said brightly. It was
wonderful to meet somebody she knew in this
big, strange city.</p>
<p>Pauline, who had not noticed Mary Louise,
looked up in surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, hello&mdash;uh&mdash;Emmy Lou,&rdquo; she replied.</p>
<p>Mary Louise laughed and stood still. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve
had all sorts of excitement at Stoddard House,
Pauline. I want to tell you about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The woman and the blond girl continued to
walk on, but Pauline stopped for a moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean besides last night?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. Another robbery. Mrs. Macgregor&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me at supper time, Emmy Lou,&rdquo; interrupted
Pauline. &ldquo;These people are in a hurry.
I&rsquo;ve got to go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary Louise was disappointed; she did so
want to ask Pauline whether Ida&rsquo;s story were
true. Now she&rsquo;d have to wait.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_88">[88]</div>
<p>She continued her walk down Walnut Street
until she came to Ninth, then she turned up to
Market Street and entered the department store
where she had made the inquiries that morning
concerning Margaret Detweiler.</p>
<p>There were not so many people visiting the
employment manager that afternoon as in the
morning: perhaps everybody thought Saturday
afternoon a poor time to look for a job. Mary
Louise was thankful for this, and apologized
profusely for taking the busy woman&rsquo;s time
again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t find anybody by the name of Ferguson
at the Benjamin Franklin Hotel now,&rdquo;
she said, &ldquo;or any trace of Margaret Detweiler
at all, there. But after I left the hotel it occurred
to me that if you would give me the address that
Margaret had while she was working here, I
might make inquiries at the boarding house, or
wherever it was that she lived. They might know
something. Do you think that would be too much
trouble?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No trouble at all,&rdquo; replied the woman pleasantly.
She told the clerk to look in the files again.
The address was a number on Pine Street, and
Mary Louise asked where that street was located,
as she copied it down in her notebook.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_89">[89]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Not far away,&rdquo; was the reply. &ldquo;You can
easily walk there in a few minutes.&rdquo; She gave
Mary Louise explicit directions.</p>
<p>It was a shabby red-brick house in a poor but
respectable neighborhood. A colored woman answered
Mary Louise&rsquo;s ring.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing today!&rdquo; said the woman instantly,
without giving Mary Louise a chance to speak
first.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not selling anything,&rdquo; replied the girl,
laughing. &ldquo;I wanted to ask the landlady here
about a girl named Margaret Detweiler who
used to live here. Could you ask her to spare
me a minute or two?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; agreed the servant. &ldquo;Come in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She ushered Mary Louise into a neat but
gloomy parlor, and in a couple of minutes the
landlady appeared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I understand you want to ask me about Miss
Detweiler?&rdquo; she inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered Mary Louise. &ldquo;I am trying
to find her for her grandparents. The employment
manager of the department store said she
lived here. Is that correct?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_90">[90]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it is. Miss Detweiler lived here for about
five months. She seemed like a nice quiet girl,
with no bad habits. She paid regular till the last
month she was here, when she took sick and had
to spend a lot of money on medicines and doctor&rsquo;s
bills. Then, all of a sudden, she slipped
away without payin&rsquo; her bill, and I never saw
her again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She owes you money?&rdquo; demanded Mary Louise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, she don&rsquo;t now. A couple of weeks after
she left, she sent it to me in a registered letter.
So we&rsquo;re square now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t she send her address?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, she didn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where was the letter postmarked?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Center Square. A little town up the state.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you still have the envelope?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I haven&rsquo;t. But I remember the name, because
I used to know folks at Center Square.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t Margaret say anything in her letter
about how she was getting on or what she was
doing?&rdquo; asked Mary Louise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There wasn&rsquo;t any letter. Just a folded piece
of paper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s too bad! And what was the date?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sometime in January. Let&rsquo;s see, it must have
been near the start of the month, for I remember
I used some of that money to buy my grandson a
birthday present, and his birthday&rsquo;s on the seventh.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_91">[91]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I thank you very much for what you
have told me,&rdquo; concluded Mary Louise. &ldquo;Maybe
it will lead to something. I&rsquo;ll go to Center
Square and make inquiries. You see,&rdquo; she explained,
&ldquo;Margaret Detweiler&rsquo;s grandparents
are very unhappy because they haven&rsquo;t heard
from her, and I want to do all in my power to
find her. Margaret is all they have, and they love
her dearly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The woman&rsquo;s eyes filled with tears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And may you have good luck, my dear
child!&rdquo; she said.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_92">[92]</div>
<h2 id="c7"><span class="small">CHAPTER VII</span>
<br /><i>The Abandoned House</i></h2>
<p>When Mary Louise returned to the hotel, she
found everything quiet. She went immediately
to the fourth floor; Mrs. Hilliard was in her sitting
room, knitting and listening to the radio.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Has anything happened since I left?&rdquo; asked
the girl eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied the manager. &ldquo;Except that another
guest has departed. Your friend Pauline
Brooks came back, packed her bag, paid her bill,
and left. Of course, she was only a transient anyway,
but the hotel is so empty that I was hoping
she would stay a while.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I met her on the street with her aunt,&rdquo; Mary
Louise said. &ldquo;But she didn&rsquo;t have time to talk
to me. Did you question her about Ida&rsquo;s story?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_93">[93]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and she said it was true that Ida did
come into her room to make the bed at that time,
because she, Miss Brooks, had slept late. But
she didn&rsquo;t know how long the maid had stayed
because she left the hotel before Mrs. Macgregor
discovered her loss and screamed. So it is possible
that Ida went back into Mrs. Macgregor&rsquo;s
room.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Personally I believe the girl is innocent,&rdquo;
stated Mary Louise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So do I. As I said, she has been with me two
years, and I have always found her absolutely
trustworthy. It probably was a sneak thief. The
police are on the lookout for somebody like
that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you talk to Miss Stoddard?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I didn&rsquo;t. She went out this afternoon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;ll bear watching,&rdquo; remarked Mary Louise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think so too,&rdquo; agreed the other....
&ldquo;Now, tell me what you did with yourself this
afternoon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary Louise related the story of her visit to
Margaret Detweiler&rsquo;s former boarding house
and the scant information she had obtained. &ldquo;Is
Center Square far away?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, a couple of hours&rsquo; drive, if you have a
car. But do you really think it would do you any
good to go there? The girl was probably only
passing through and stopped at the postoffice to
mail her letter to the landlady.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_94">[94]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I am afraid that is all there was to it.
But I could at least make inquiries, and after
all, it&rsquo;s the only clue I have. I&rsquo;d never be satisfied
if I didn&rsquo;t do the very best I could to find
Margaret for her grandparents.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary Louise stayed a little longer with Mrs.
Hilliard; then she went to her own room to dress
for dinner. But suddenly she was terribly homesick.
Jane and the boys would be coasting all
afternoon, she knew, for there would still be
plenty of snow left in the country, and there was
a dance tonight at another friend&rsquo;s. Max would
be coming for her in his runabout; she would be
wearing her blue silk dress&mdash;and&mdash;and&mdash;&mdash;Her
eyes filled with tears. Wasn&rsquo;t she just being terribly
foolish to stay here in Philadelphia, missing
all those good times? And for what? There
wasn&rsquo;t a chance in the world that she&rsquo;d discover
the thief, when even the police were unsuccessful.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I&rsquo;ll never learn to be a detective until I
try&mdash;and&mdash;learn to accept failures,&rdquo; she told
herself sternly, and she knew that, all things considered,
she had not been foolish. It might be
hard at the time to give up all the fun, but in
the long run it would be worth it. She ought
to be thanking her lucky stars for the chance!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_95">[95]</div>
<p>Somewhat reassured, she dressed and went
downstairs to the reception room, where the
radio was playing. She found the two Walder
girls, whom she had met at noontime when Mrs.
Macgregor raised the commotion. Mary Louise
greeted them cordially.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s beginning to rain,&rdquo; said Evelyn Walder,
&ldquo;so Sis and I thought we&rsquo;d stay in tonight and
try to get up a game of bridge. Do you play,
Mary Lou?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, indeed,&rdquo; replied Mary Louise. &ldquo;I love
it. Whom shall we get for a fourth? Mrs. Hilliard?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Hilliard doesn&rsquo;t like to play, and besides,
she has to get up and answer the telephone
so much that she usually just knits in the evenings.
Maybe we can get one of the Fletcher
girls.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I heard Lucy say that they had a date,&rdquo;
returned Ruth Walder.</p>
<p>Mary Louise looked disappointed; she was so
anxious to meet all the guests at Stoddard House.
She had an inspiration, however. &ldquo;How about
Miss Stoddard?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;Does she play?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The other two girls looked at Mary Louise
in amazement.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_96">[96]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, she plays bridge,&rdquo; replied Evelyn. &ldquo;But
we don&rsquo;t want her! If you don&rsquo;t mind my slang,
I&rsquo;ll say she&rsquo;s a pain in the neck.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary Louise smiled: she thought so too.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Weinberger is nice, even if she is a lot
older than we are,&rdquo; observed Ruth. &ldquo;And she
loves to play, because her daughter goes out
every Saturday night with her boy-friend, I
think.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The others agreed to this suggestion, and Mrs.
Weinberger accepted the invitation immediately.
So the evening passed pleasantly, but
Mary Louise did not feel that she had learned
anything of value to her job.</p>
<p>The party broke up about ten-thirty; Mary
Louise went to her room and took out her notebook.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s getting so confusing,&rdquo; she mused. &ldquo;So
many things stolen, so many people involved.
These two robberies since I came&mdash;the one in
my room last night, and Mrs. Macgregor&rsquo;s today&mdash;make
five in all. I wonder if they could
all have been done by the same person. Maybe&mdash;maybe
it&rsquo;s a secret band of some kind! With
Miss Henrietta Stoddard as its leader!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her one determination, when she awakened
the next morning, was to have a talk with Miss
Stoddard. Accordingly, after breakfast she asked
Mrs. Hilliard how that could best be arranged.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_97">[97]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Stoddard always goes to Christ
Church,&rdquo; was the reply. &ldquo;Why couldn&rsquo;t you plan
to go with her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a wonderful idea, Mrs. Hilliard! I
always did want to visit Christ Church&mdash;we read
so much about it in history.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll ask her to take you with her,&rdquo; offered
the manager, &ldquo;when she comes out of the dining
room.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The arrangement was easily made, and a couple
of hours later Mary Louise met Miss Stoddard
in the lobby of the hotel. Today the spinster
was not wearing the shabby brown suit; indeed,
she looked quite neat and stylish in a dark blue
coat trimmed with fur.</p>
<p>The rain had washed most of the snow away,
and the sun was shining, so both Mary Louise
and Miss Stoddard thought it would be pleasant
to walk down to Second and Market streets,
where the historic church was situated. For a
while they talked of its significance in colonial
Philadelphia, and Miss Stoddard promised to
show Mary Louise the pew in which George
Washington and his family had worshiped.</p>
<p>It was Miss Stoddard, however, who gave the
conversation a personal turn.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_98">[98]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You saw me come out of that pawnshop yesterday,
didn&rsquo;t you, Miss Gay?&rdquo; she inquired. &ldquo;I
wanted to ask you not to say anything about my
visit to Mrs. Hilliard or to any of the other
guests.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it is nothing to be ashamed of, Miss Stoddard,&rdquo;
protested Mary Louise. &ldquo;Lots of people
pawn things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know. But not women of my type, usually.
I&rsquo;m rather hard pressed for money now, so I sold
an old brooch of my mother&rsquo;s. It didn&rsquo;t bring
much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary Louise nodded and looked at her companion.
But she could not tell whether she were
telling the truth or not.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; continued Miss Stoddard, &ldquo;my visit
might look suspicious to some people&mdash;after all
these robberies at the hotel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I suppose that&rsquo;s true.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it really proves my innocence, because if
I had taken all that money of Mrs. Macgregor&rsquo;s
I shouldn&rsquo;t be rushing to a pawnshop now to get
a little more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That was a good point; Mary Louise had not
thought of it before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who do you think did all the stealing, Miss
Stoddard?&rdquo; she asked point-blank.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_99">[99]</div>
<p>&ldquo;The Weinberger girl! I suppose you&rsquo;d call
her a woman, but she seems like just a girl to
me. She and the young man she goes with are
in league together. I think he&rsquo;s out of work, and
the two of them have been planning to get married.
So they&rsquo;ve been stealing right and left.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Even her own mother&rsquo;s watch?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, even that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary Louise was silent. It was an entirely new
idea to her. Yet it was possible; the Weinbergers
had been at Stoddard House ever since the things
began to be stolen. If Hortense Weinberger were
going to marry this young man of hers, she could
use the silverware, the vase, and the painting in
her new house or apartment. The watches could
be pawned, and the money would be enough to
keep the young couple for a while.... Yes, the
explanation was logical.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have reason to believe that this couple will
elope tonight,&rdquo; announced Miss Stoddard.</p>
<p>Mary Louise&rsquo;s eyes opened wide with excitement.
&ldquo;If that man is the thief, and if I can see
him to identify him,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;maybe that will
solve the mystery. You remember, Miss Stoddard,
a man stole my watch. He was short and
of slight build&mdash;but of course I couldn&rsquo;t see his
face. Is Miss Weinberger&rsquo;s friend like that?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_100">[100]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. I never saw him. But I overheard
a phone call, and Hortense Weinberger
said she&rsquo;d slip out about eleven tonight. Could
you be watching then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes!&rdquo; cried Mary Louise joyfully. Oh,
suppose it were true, and she could identify the
man! Wouldn&rsquo;t it be too wonderful?</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think you&rsquo;re terribly clever, Miss Stoddard,&rdquo;
she said, &ldquo;if you really have found the
solution. It will mean so much to Mrs. Hilliard.
She has been worried to death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They had been so interested in their conversation
that they did not realize how near they were
to the church. In another minute they were walking
reverently into the old building, and for the
next hour and a half, robberies and mysteries
were forgotten in the solemn beauty of the service.
Nor did they refer to the subject afterwards,
but walked back to the hotel talking about historic
Philadelphia.</p>
<p>Mary Louise went to her room after dinner
and wrote down everything Miss Stoddard had
said about Hortense Weinberger. The explanation
was so plausible that she could hardly wait
for the evening to come, with her chance to identify
her own particular burglar. If he were the
man who had entered her room, the whole thing
would be solved and she could go home for
Christmas! Oh, how glad she was that she had
had that talk with Miss Stoddard!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_101">[101]</div>
<p>In the midst of her daydreams a knock
sounded at the door. A maid handed her a card
with the name &ldquo;Max Miller&rdquo; engraved on it.</p>
<p>Mary Louise let out a wild whoop of joy and,
not waiting to explain, dashed past the maid and
down the steps to the lobby. And there he was.
Good old Max&mdash;looking handsomer than ever!
Mary Louise could have hugged him in her delight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Max! You angel!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;How did you
know I&rsquo;d be so glad to see you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because I knew how glad I&rsquo;d be to see you,&rdquo;
he replied, still holding onto her hand.</p>
<p>Mary Louise withdrew it laughingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Women talk,&rdquo; she reminded him, glancing
about her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O.K.,&rdquo; he grinned. &ldquo;How are you? Solved
your mystery yet?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh no. I&rsquo;ve had my own watch and five dollars
stolen&mdash;that&rsquo;s all!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you call this a good time! Well, Mary
Lou, you certainly can take it.... But haven&rsquo;t
you had enough, little girl? Please come home
with me!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_102">[102]</div>
<p>Mary Louise&rsquo;s eyes flashed in anger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that what you came here for, Max Miller?&rdquo;
she demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No&mdash;oh, no! I didn&rsquo;t expect you&rsquo;d come
home. I just wanted to see you, so I drove down.
Started early this morning. Now let&rsquo;s go places
and do things!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where? You can&rsquo;t do much in Philadelphia
on Sunday.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anywhere. We can take a drive and have our
supper at some nice place away from this henhouse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, Max&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get your coat and hat. There&rsquo;s a good girl.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Max, you must be sick of driving. And
if you expect to start back tonight&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t. I&rsquo;m staying over at the Y.M. for a
couple of days. So I can watch you. Now, don&rsquo;t
get excited! I have your parents&rsquo; consent. In
fact, they thought it was a bully idea. You may
be a wonderful detective, Mary Lou, but just the
same you&rsquo;re a darned pretty girl. And pretty
girls alone in strange cities....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have Mrs. Hilliard,&rdquo; she reminded him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I know. That&rsquo;s what makes it <i>look</i> all
right. But it doesn&rsquo;t make you safe, just the same.
You could easily be kidnaped.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_103">[103]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not going to follow me everywhere I
go, are you?&rdquo; she asked, in concern.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. Just keep an eye on you for a couple
of days. And maybe help you a bit. With a car
at your disposal, you may be able to clear up
things quicker and go home in time for the senior
prom. That&rsquo;s my little scheme, in a nutshell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will be wonderful,&rdquo; agreed Mary Louise.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll admit there have been moments when I&rsquo;ve
been homesick, Max.&rdquo; Her eyes brightened. &ldquo;I
know where I want to go this afternoon! To
Center Square.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. Out in the country somewhere&mdash;you
can look it up on your map.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O.K. I&rsquo;m ready, Mary Lou. The car is at the
door. Run up and get your hat and coat. Wrap
up warmly. It&rsquo;s a lot warmer, and most of the
snow&rsquo;s gone, but you know my runabout isn&rsquo;t like
a heated limousine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In five minutes she was back again, looking
very pretty in her squirrel coat, with its matching
toque. Leaving word for Mrs. Hilliard that
she would not be back for supper, she got into
the car with Max.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_104">[104]</div>
<p>As the couple started, Mary Louise explained
why she wanted to go to Center Square: that her
project had nothing to do with the thefts at the
hotel but was the hope of tracing Margaret Detweiler.
And she told her companion the facts she
had learned about the girl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m even more anxious to find her than to
solve the mystery at Stoddard House,&rdquo; she said,
&ldquo;because of those two old people. It&rsquo;s just too
dreadful for them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Max nodded. He knew the Detweilers and
felt extremely sorry for them. Everybody in
Riverside liked them and pitied them in their
distress.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I just can&rsquo;t bear to tell them that Margaret
was dismissed from the department store for
stealing,&rdquo; she added.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; advised Max. &ldquo;Better tell them
nothing at all than that. It wouldn&rsquo;t help any and
would only cause them unhappiness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary Louise asked about everything that had
happened at Riverside since she had left. It had
been only two days, but it seemed like an age.
Max described the party the night before, but it
was a poor affair without Mary Lou, according
to his idea, and he had left early so he could get
off at daybreak this morning.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_105">[105]</div>
<p>The day was clear and warm, and except for
the slush on the roads the drive was delightful.
The young people were happy to be together
again and enjoyed every minute of it.</p>
<p>It was already dusk of the short winter day
when they arrived at Center Square and stopped
at the country hotel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to want dinner in an hour or so,&rdquo;
Max told the clerk. &ldquo;But first we want to see
whether we can locate a girl who was here late
last winter. Did a young woman named Margaret
Detweiler ever register here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The clerk obligingly looked through his book.
But the name was not there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s tall and slender and very dark,&rdquo; said
Mary Louise. &ldquo;Has wavy hair and an olive
complexion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The clerk shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t remember seein&rsquo; anybody like
that around. Not many strangers come here&mdash;except
automobile parties sometimes, stoppin&rsquo; to
eat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are there any empty houses she might have
rented?&rdquo; was Mary Louise&rsquo;s next question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;None rented as I know of. There&rsquo;s some
abandoned houses around, places where people
sometimes come just for the summer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The clerk gave the directions.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_106">[106]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Now one more question. Where does the
postmaster live? For of course the postoffice is
closed on Sunday.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure it&rsquo;s closed. But the postmaster lives right
over top of it. Across the street a way from here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary Louise and Max went there next and
were fortunate enough to find the man at home.
When Mary Louise told him about the registered
letter and described the girl, he said he
believed he did remember. So few people came
to the little country town; still fewer registered
letters. But Margaret hadn&rsquo;t stopped in a car,
he thought&mdash;she had walked from somewhere.
No, he was positive she hadn&rsquo;t been boarding
with any of the folks around, or he&rsquo;d have heard
of it.</p>
<p>Well, that was something definite! Maybe she
was hiding in one of those empty houses the
clerk had spoken of, to escape from the police.</p>
<p>Max turned his car off the main highway into
a little dirt road, almost impassable with its slush
and snow. He stopped in front of the first empty
house which the clerk had described. It was dark
and forlorn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There would be some sort of light if anybody
were living there,&rdquo; observed Max.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_107">[107]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t tell,&rdquo; replied Mary Louise. &ldquo;If
Margaret were hiding, she&rsquo;d be careful about
lights. Let&rsquo;s get out and look.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why should she hide? Didn&rsquo;t you tell me
the employment manager promised not to send
her to jail?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but you don&rsquo;t know what crimes she&rsquo;s
committed since. If she were behaving herself,
wouldn&rsquo;t she have written to her grandparents?
Either she&rsquo;s dead or she&rsquo;s doing something
wrong.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They waded through slush over their shoe-tops
but could see no signs of any life. Mary
Louise decided to try another house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a wild theory, Mary Lou, but you&rsquo;re the
doctor,&rdquo; agreed Max. &ldquo;So long as my bus&rsquo;ll run,
I&rsquo;m game.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are a sport, Max! I don&rsquo;t know what I&rsquo;d
do without you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Men are helpful sometimes, aren&rsquo;t they?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess they&rsquo;re absolutely necessary,&rdquo; replied
Mary Louise modestly. &ldquo;I never seem to be able
to get along without them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the proper attitude for a girl,&rdquo; he answered
gayly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_108">[108]</div>
<p>Farther along the road they stopped in front
of another empty house. It was situated at the
top of a steep incline and almost completely surrounded
by trees.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can you climb that hill, Max?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can try&mdash;if you think there&rsquo;s any use,&rdquo; he
replied.</p>
<p>It was a difficult task, for the driveway was so
covered with slush that it was hard to tell which
was road and which was field. But Max made it
in low gear, and they came to a stop in front
of a barn, under a big tree.</p>
<p>The house was shabby and unpainted; its windows
were covered with boards, and its heavy
doors without glass. Mary Louise shuddered: it
reminded her of Dark Cedars.</p>
<p>Max turned off the motor and jumped out of
the car.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nobody home, I guess,&rdquo; he announced.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_109">[109]</div>
<p>From her seat in the car Mary Louise stared
at the house, peering into the strip of glass above
the boards on the windows. She thought she saw
a flicker of light, as if a candle were burning.
Yes, she was sure of it&mdash;and&mdash;a face appeared at
the window! Two frightened eyes looked right
into hers. A second later another face appeared,
more plainly than the first, for this person evidently
had hold of the candle. The first face had
vanished, and Mary Louise saw only that of an
exceedingly ugly woman&mdash;someone who looked
somehow familiar.</p>
<p>That very instant the tiny light went out, and
at the same moment Mary Louise sank unconscious
in her seat. A stone, hurled from the tree
above her, had hit her right on the head!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_110">[110]</div>
<h2 id="c8"><span class="small">CHAPTER VIII</span>
<br /><i>Knocked Out</i></h2>
<p>Max, who was standing on the ground near
by, heard the heavy thud of the stone as it hit
the floor of the car. Turning about sharply, he
saw Mary Louise slumped in her seat, unconscious
from the blow. He flung open the door
and jumped in beside her.</p>
<p><a id="rfront" href="#front">&ldquo;Mary Lou! Mary Lou! Are you alive?&rdquo; he cried desperately.</a></p>
<p>The girl did not answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Help! Help!&rdquo; he shrieked, at the top of his
lungs.</p>
<p>A mocking laugh sounded from the tree above.
Max looked up, but in the darkness he could see
no one. How he wished he had his flashlight!
But it was behind in the rumble seat, and he
daren&rsquo;t waste a minute; he must get Mary Lou
to a doctor with all possible speed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_111">[111]</div>
<p>Starting his engine immediately&mdash;for there
was no reply to his call for help&mdash;he circled
around the tree and crept cautiously down the
slippery hill, praying as he had never prayed
before. Oh, suppose Mary Louise were dead!</p>
<p>With as much speed as he dared put on, he
drove back to the Center Square hotel. As he
came to a stop he felt a little movement beside
him, and Mary Louise raised her head and
opened her eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where are we, Max?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;What happened?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, my darling!&rdquo; he cried, flinging his arm
around her shoulders. &ldquo;You are alive!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl managed a feeble laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course I am. My head hurts dreadfully,
though. What happened?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You were hit by a stone&mdash;see it there, on the
floor?&mdash;from that tree we were parked under.
It knocked you out.... Now, can you manage
to walk up to the hotel, or shall I carry you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can walk,&rdquo; she replied, taking his arm.</p>
<p>In the light of the hotel doorway Max saw
the blood running down her neck. He wiped it
with his handkerchief.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can we have a doctor immediately?&rdquo; he
asked the hotel clerk the moment they were inside
the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, there&rsquo;s one in the dining room now,
eating his dinner. I&rsquo;ll call him. An accident?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_112">[112]</div>
<p>Max explained the strange happening at the
empty house, but the clerk said he did not know
anything about the place. He had not heard of
any gangsters in these parts.</p>
<p>The doctor came immediately and dressed
Mary Louise&rsquo;s head. The cut was not serious, he
assured her; it was not in a vital place. When
it was washed and bandaged she was able to eat
her dinner with enjoyment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe that first person I saw was Margaret
Detweiler,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I wish I could stay here
all night and go investigate tomorrow. But
Mother wouldn&rsquo;t approve of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should say not!&rdquo; thundered Max. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m taking
you back to Mrs. Hilliard tonight, and I
think you had better go home to Riverside tomorrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed I won&rsquo;t, Max. And that reminds me,
I have to be at the hotel tonight at eleven o&rsquo;clock.
I want to spy on an elopement.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Elopement! What next?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_113">[113]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, one of the guests, a Miss Stoddard, who
happens to be a niece of the founder of Stoddard
House, thinks another guest is eloping tonight.
She thinks this couple are responsible for all the
robberies at the hotel. You know it was a man
who entered my room and stole my watch, so I
hoped maybe I could identify this fellow as the
burglar. If I could, the mystery would be
solved.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you could go home?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, unless I could find out something more
about Margaret Detweiler. But I wouldn&rsquo;t stay
here just on purpose for that. I&rsquo;d go home and
see what I could do from there, with Dad&rsquo;s
help.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What time is it now, I wonder?&rdquo; asked Max.
&ldquo;We must get back without fail!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; replied Mary Louise regretfully.
&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t any watch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to buy you one for Christmas, if I
get a check from Dad,&rdquo; announced Max. &ldquo;Of
course, it will be late, but I&rsquo;ll give you your other
present first, so you wouldn&rsquo;t mind that, would
you, Mary Lou?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll do nothing of the sort!&rdquo; protested the
girl. &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t accept it. If you get a check
from your father it&rsquo;s to buy something for yourself.
I&rsquo;ll get an Ingersoll tomorrow when I&rsquo;m
in town.... Now, what time is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s half-past eight. If you feel able, I think
we better go along, because I don&rsquo;t dare drive
too fast on these slippery roads at night.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_114">[114]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m all right&mdash;I only have a headache now.
So let&rsquo;s get going.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Max paid the bill, and they were off.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, what will your plans be for tomorrow?&rdquo;
he inquired, as they rode along.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to come out here and visit that empty
house with a policeman,&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;If it&rsquo;s
possible, I will. But of course I have to see what
turns up at the hotel. That is my real job: I&rsquo;m
being paid for it, and my father and Mrs. Hilliard
are counting on me to do my best.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t care if you never saw Center
Square again,&rdquo; muttered Max resentfully. &ldquo;Still,
it would be great to catch the guy who threw
that rock at you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And find out whether the girl really was
Margaret Detweiler. Yes, and I&rsquo;d like to see
that ugly woman again. I&rsquo;ve seen her face before
somewhere, but I can&rsquo;t place her. You don&rsquo;t forget
a face like that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s something crooked about their hiding
in that house,&rdquo; remarked Max.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_115">[115]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, of course.... Well, to continue with
my plans: I&rsquo;ll see what develops tonight. If
there really is an elopement, I&rsquo;ll try to identify
that man. If he isn&rsquo;t anything like my burglar,
I&rsquo;ll believe that Miss Stoddard is guilty herself
and that she just made the whole story up to
throw suspicion away from herself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Max regarded her admiringly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are a pretty clever girl, Mary Lou,&rdquo; he
said. &ldquo;I do think you&rsquo;ll make a swell detective.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks, Max. But I&rsquo;m afraid there&rsquo;s nothing
clever about that. It&rsquo;s just using common sense.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, the good detectives say that&rsquo;s the most
important thing: not to let anything escape their
notice and to use common sense all the time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They talked of other things for a while, of
school and dances and basketball. Finally they
reached Stoddard House, a little after ten
o&rsquo;clock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I do hope we&rsquo;re in time!&rdquo; exclaimed
Mary Louise.</p>
<p>They found the hotel almost deserted. Mrs.
Hilliard was sitting in a chair, knitting. Nobody
else was around.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you have a good time, dear?&rdquo; she asked,
after Max had been introduced to her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;An exciting time,&rdquo; replied the young man.
&ldquo;Mary Lou was hit on the head with a stone
and knocked out. But detectives have to expect
that sort of thing, I suppose.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_116">[116]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Sh!&rdquo; warned the girl. &ldquo;Nobody except Mrs.
Hilliard is supposed to know I&rsquo;m acting as detective.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t k-n-o-w that!&rdquo; apologized Max, in
the tone of Joe Penner.</p>
<p>Mrs. Hilliard looked troubled. &ldquo;Tell me what
happened,&rdquo; she urged.</p>
<p>Briefly Mary Louise related the story, and the
good woman was relieved to hear that the blow
was not serious. She was thankful, too, that the
job at Stoddard House had not been responsible
for it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are the Weinbergers still here?&rdquo; was Mary
Louise&rsquo;s next question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Weinberger is. But her daughter went
out early this afternoon, and I don&rsquo;t think she
came back. Her mother was in a great stew at
supper time. You would think from the way she
carries on that her daughter was a girl in her
teens instead of a woman of twenty-eight or so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A look of disappointment crossed Mary
Louise&rsquo;s face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must see Miss Stoddard,&rdquo; she announced.
&ldquo;Max, you wait here with Mrs. Hilliard till I
come back, because I may need you. I shan&rsquo;t be
gone long.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She ran off and took the elevator to the third
floor and knocked at Miss Stoddard&rsquo;s door.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_117">[117]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Who is it?&rdquo; was the query.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mary Louise Gay. May I come in, Miss
Stoddard?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The woman turned the key in the lock and
opened the door. She was dressed in a kimono
and slippers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re too late, Miss Gay,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Miss
Weinberger has already eloped. I&rsquo;m sure of it.
I saw her get into a taxi this afternoon, and one
of the maids came out and brought her her suitcase.
She probably had hidden it somewhere
from her mother. She&rsquo;s probably married by
now&mdash;and run off with all the money and
jewelry from Stoddard House!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; gasped Mary Louise in dismay. &ldquo;Why
wasn&rsquo;t I here! Did you see the man, Miss Stoddard?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No&mdash;unless he was the taxi driver. But I
didn&rsquo;t even get a good look at him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Probably she was to join him somewhere.
He wouldn&rsquo;t risk coming near the house in
broad daylight if he was the burglar who
entered my room.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, that&rsquo;s true.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_118">[118]</div>
<p>&ldquo;If Hortense Weinberger really is married,&rdquo;
said Mary Louise, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t you suppose her
mother will hear about it tomorrow? And if I
keep in touch with her mother, I ought to see
the man when he comes back from the honeymoon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Weinberger was planning to leave
Stoddard House tomorrow,&rdquo; returned Miss
Stoddard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I know. But this may alter her plans.
And besides, she will surely give her forwarding
address to Mrs. Hilliard. She has no reason
to hide; she doesn&rsquo;t have any idea that her
daughter or her husband is suspected of stealing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope you&rsquo;re right, Miss Gay.... Now,
tell me what happened to your head.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was riding in an open car, and a stone fell
out of a tree and hit me,&rdquo; she answered simply.</p>
<p>The older woman pulled down the corners of
her mouth and looked doubtful.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, she&rsquo;s thinking I&rsquo;m just a wild
young girl,&rdquo; Mary Louise concluded. But it
really didn&rsquo;t matter in the least to her what Miss
Stoddard chose to believe about her. &ldquo;Well, I
must get to bed, Miss Stoddard,&rdquo; she said aloud.
&ldquo;So good-night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good-night,&rdquo; returned the other, carefully
locking the door after Mary Louise went out.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_119">[119]</div>
<p>A moment later the girl joined Mrs. Hilliard
and Max on the first floor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Stoddard thinks Miss Weinberger
eloped this afternoon,&rdquo; she announced.</p>
<p>Mrs. Hilliard laughed incredulously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Old maids love to imagine romances,&rdquo; she
said. &ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;ll see.... Now, don&rsquo;t you
think you had better go to bed?&rdquo; she asked Mary
Louise in a motherly way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I do,&rdquo; agreed the girl, &ldquo;Max, if you&rsquo;re
still here, I&rsquo;d be glad to have you come to lunch
with me tomorrow. We&rsquo;re allowed to have men
to meals, aren&rsquo;t we, Mrs. Hilliard?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly, dear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nix on that!&rdquo; protested the young man immediately.
&ldquo;Can you imagine me&mdash;one lone fellow&mdash;in
that dining room full of dames? Looking
me over and snickering at the way I wear
my hair or tie my shoes? Nothing doing! I&rsquo;ll
call for you at one, Mary Lou, and we&rsquo;ll go out
somewhere to lunch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O.K.,&rdquo; agreed the girl, smiling. &ldquo;See you
then!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_120">[120]</div>
<h2 id="c9"><span class="small">CHAPTER IX</span>
<br /><i>Lunch at the Bellevue</i></h2>
<p>Mary Louise slept late the following morning.
The dining-room doors had been closed for an
hour when Mrs. Hilliard finally came into her
room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What time is it, Mrs. Hilliard?&rdquo; she inquired,
opening her eyes and staring at the
bright sunlight pouring through the windows.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s almost eleven o&rsquo;clock. I thought you had
better sleep this morning, Mary Louise, on
account of your head. How do you feel?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m all right, Mrs. Hilliard, thank you.
But this is no time for anybody with a job to
get up! I&rsquo;ll get fired.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The woman laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear, you are doing all that anybody
could do, I believe. I am afraid the situation is
hopeless. Mrs. Weinberger moved out this
morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did she hear from her daughter?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_121">[121]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, she had a telegram. She is married and
has gone to New York for a honeymoon over
Christmas.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did her mother take it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very badly. She seemed all cut up about it.
The man has a job as a taxi driver, and though
Mrs. Weinberger has never met him, she is sure
he is a rough, uneducated fellow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Stoddard thinks he is our thief,&rdquo; announced
Mary Louise. &ldquo;She believes he has
been working with Miss Weinberger&rsquo;s help.&rdquo;
Mrs. Hilliard&rsquo;s eyes opened wide in astonishment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That might be possible,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. You remember it was a man who
entered my room Friday night. And with Miss
Weinberger to watch out for him, he could have
sneaked into &rsquo;most any of the rooms. That&rsquo;s the
theory I wanted to work on today. Where did
Mrs. Weinberger go?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To the Bellevue&mdash;temporarily. She said that
she&rsquo;d find something cheaper later on and send
me her forwarding address. But she will stay at
the big hotel for a few days, till her daughter
comes back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I&rsquo;m going to go see her there. Isn&rsquo;t
there something she left that I could take over
to her, to use for an excuse?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_122">[122]</div>
<p>&ldquo;A special-delivery letter arrived a few minutes
ago. I was going to send it over this afternoon
by one of the maids.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me take it! And I&rsquo;ll have Max take me
there to lunch so I can say I was coming to the
hotel anyway. Where is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Broad and Walnut&mdash;right across the street
from the Ritz Carlton. Your friend will probably
know.... Now, you get dressed, Mary
Louise, and come over to my apartment for a
cup of coffee. You must have something before
you leave.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks very much, Mrs. Hilliard. If it isn&rsquo;t
too much trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was ready before one o&rsquo;clock, her bandage
entirely covered by her hat, and was waiting
downstairs in the lobby for Max when he arrived.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re looking fine today, Mary Lou!&rdquo; he
exclaimed admiringly. &ldquo;How&rsquo;s the head?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s all right. Max, could we go to the
Bellevue for lunch? And will you please let me
pay the bill&mdash;out of my salary? Because it&rsquo;s on
account of the job that I want to go there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure we can go,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;But nix on the
bill. Unless you eat everything on the bill of
fare.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_123">[123]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I know, but it&rsquo;s a big hotel, and it may be
dreadfully expensive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll see,&rdquo; he agreed.</p>
<p>Max left his car in an open-air garage near
the hotel, and the two young people entered together.
Mary Louise thought it was a lovely
place, and she pressed Max&rsquo;s arm jubilantly.
What fun it was to have a companion! She
wouldn&rsquo;t have enjoyed lunching there alone at
all, but having Max made it seem like a party.</p>
<p>The hotel was quite crowded, probably with
numerous vacation guests and Christmas shoppers,
and the young couple made their way
slowly to the dining room. In the passageway
they suddenly came upon Pauline Brooks with
another girl&mdash;the same blond girl she had been
with on Walnut Street the preceding Saturday
noon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pauline!&rdquo; exclaimed Mary Louise. &ldquo;How
are you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pauline turned around, and seeing Mary
Louise&rsquo;s handsome companion her smile included
him. Mary Louise introduced Max, and
Pauline in turn introduced the cute little blond
as Miss Jackson. The girl immediately began to
roll her eyes at Max.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_124">[124]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I was so disappointed that you moved away
from Stoddard House,&rdquo; said Mary Louise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t like the atmosphere,&rdquo; replied Pauline.
&ldquo;Too much stealing. I was afraid I
wouldn&rsquo;t have anything left if I stayed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you didn&rsquo;t lose anything, did you?&rdquo; asked
Mary Louise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, but I wasn&rsquo;t taking any chances. Besides,
it&rsquo;s a lot more comfortable here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here? I thought you were at the Ritz?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pauline laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was. But my aunt went out to the country,
so I moved over here. Like it better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Suddenly a thought came to Mary Louise:
That woman whom she had seen in the empty
house&mdash;her face looked like Pauline&rsquo;s aunt!
That was the person she had reminded her of!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is your aunt&rsquo;s place at Center Square?&rdquo; she
inquired.</p>
<p>Mary Louise thought she saw Pauline start
at the question, but she answered it carelessly
enough. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not in any town,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Just in
the country.... Well, I&rsquo;ll be seein&rsquo; you.&rdquo; She
started away.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_125">[125]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Wait a minute,&rdquo; begged Mary Louise. &ldquo;Did
you girls ever meet a girl named Margaret Detweiler,
from Riverside? I am trying to find her
for her grandmother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Margaret Detweiler&mdash;yes&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; began Miss
Jackson.</p>
<p>But Pauline interrupted her. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re thinking
of Margaret Lyla, Blondie,&rdquo; she corrected. &ldquo;We
don&rsquo;t know any Margaret Detweiler.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; agreed the other girl, in obvious
confusion.</p>
<p>Mary Louise sighed: she had probably been
mistaken. And it was all so mixed up, anyhow.
Her memory of the night before, of those two
faces at the window, was already growing vague.</p>
<p>She and Max went on into the dining room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some high-steppers,&rdquo; remarked Max. &ldquo;Not
your type, Mary Lou.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care for the little blonde,&rdquo; agreed
Mary Louise. &ldquo;But I did sort of like Pauline
Brooks. She was my first friend here in Philadelphia,
and she seemed awfully sociable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like her,&rdquo; said Max emphatically.</p>
<p>Of course, Mary Louise was flattered, and she
smiled contentedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you needn&rsquo;t worry&mdash;she&rsquo;ll never be one
of my best friends,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_126">[126]</div>
<p>The waiter led them to a table with a pretty
bouquet on the shining white linen cover, and
Mary Louise felt almost as if she were at a party.
An orchestra was playing, and there were many
people dancing. Everything here spoke of gayety
and life: no wonder Pauline Brooks referred
the Bellevue to Stoddard House. But she
must be very rich to be able to stay here.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A big city is grand, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; she remarked
to Max, her eyes sparkling with excitement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sometimes,&rdquo; he admitted. &ldquo;But it can be
an awfully lonely place too, Mary Lou. It all
depends on who is with you.&rdquo; And his eyes told
her who the person was whom he preferred.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I guess you&rsquo;re right, Max. I was lonely&mdash;and
it was wonderful of you to come. I wish
you could stay the whole time here with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m supposed to go back tonight, or tomorrow
morning early at the latest. But I could
break that on one condition.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; demanded Mary Louise.</p>
<p>He lowered his voice to almost a whisper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mary Lou, you know how much I care for
you. You know I&rsquo;ve adored you since the first
minute I met you. There&rsquo;s never been anybody
else. Let&rsquo;s get married&mdash;&#8203;now&mdash;&#8203;today&mdash;and keep
it secret till I graduate in June. Then&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_127">[127]</div>
<p>The waiter approached diplomatically. Mary
Louise picked up the menu in confusion. She
had never dreamed Max would suggest such a
thing. Why, she had no idea of getting married
for years and years!</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take this special luncheon,&rdquo; she said,
noticing that its cost was moderate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will too,&rdquo; added Max, anxious to get rid
of the waiter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you say, Mary Lou? Will you?&rdquo;
His voice was so eager that the girl was deeply
touched.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh no, Max. I couldn&rsquo;t. I don&rsquo;t love you&mdash;or
anybody&mdash;that way yet. And I couldn&rsquo;t deceive
my parents or let you deceive yours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We might just tell our fathers and mothers,&rdquo;
he suggested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no, I couldn&rsquo;t. Let&rsquo;s don&rsquo;t even talk
about it. I&rsquo;m here in Philadelphia on a detective
job, and I mean to give it my very best. I&rsquo;ll be
sorry to have you go home, but maybe it will
be better. I&rsquo;ll work harder if I haven&rsquo;t anybody
to play around with. Now&mdash;what would you say
to a dance while we wait for our first course?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The couple glided off to the music, and more
than one person in that big dining room noticed
the graceful, handsome pair and envied them
their happiness. When they came back to their
seats their soup was ready for them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_128">[128]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Here come your friends,&rdquo; remarked Max,
as Pauline Brooks and her blond companion entered
the dining room. &ldquo;And take a look at the
fellows they have with them!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like their looks,&rdquo; announced Mary
Louise emphatically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Neither do I, needless to say. Just goes to
show you what kind of girls they are.... Mary
Lou, I want you to drop that Brooks woman. She
might get you into harm. Promise me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No need to promise,&rdquo; laughed Mary Louise.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll probably never see her again now that she&rsquo;s
moved away from Stoddard House.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary Louise ate her luncheon with keen enjoyment.
There was nothing like going without
breakfast, she said, to give you an appetite for
lunch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think there&rsquo;s any chance of your getting
home for Christmas?&rdquo; asked Max wistfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t believe so,&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;I try
not to think about it. It will be my first Christmas
away from home, the first time I ever didn&rsquo;t
hang up my stocking. But, Max, if I could solve
this mystery for Mrs. Hillard, it would be worth
ten Christmas stockings to me. I just can&rsquo;t tell
you what it means.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_129">[129]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I realize that. But it doesn&rsquo;t seem right.
The fun at home&mdash;visiting each other&rsquo;s houses
after dinner, and the Christmas dance at the
Country Club! Gosh, Mary Lou, I just can&rsquo;t
bear it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Max, I&rsquo;ll be the homesick one&mdash;not
you,&rdquo; she reminded him.</p>
<p>Her eyes traveled around the room while
they were waiting for their dessert, and she
caught sight of Mrs. Weinberger, eating a lonely
lunch in a corner by a window, looking as if she
didn&rsquo;t care whether she lived or died. Mary
Louise felt dreadfully sorry for her; she was
glad to have an excuse to go to speak to her after
lunch.</p>
<p>She took Max over and introduced him. Mrs.
Weinberger acknowledged the introduction, but
she did not smile. She looked as if she might
never smile again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yet how much gloomier she would be if she
knew we suspected her daughter and her husband
of those crimes!&rdquo; thought Mary Louise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have a special-delivery letter for you, Mrs.
Weinberger,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I was coming here for
lunch, so Mrs. Hilliard asked me to bring it
over to you.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_130">[130]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; replied the woman, taking the
letter and splitting the envelope immediately.
&ldquo;You heard that my daughter is married, Miss
Gay?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Mrs. Hilliard told me.&rdquo; Mary Louise
longed to ask when the honeymooners would be
back, but she hesitated because Mrs. Weinberger
looked so gloomy.</p>
<p>The woman drew a snapshot from the envelope.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, here is their picture!&rdquo; she exclaimed.
&ldquo;And&mdash;he&rsquo;s positively handsome!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eagerly she handed the photograph to Mary
Louise, anxious for the girl&rsquo;s good opinion of
the new son-in-law.</p>
<p>What an opportunity for the young detective!
Mary Louise&rsquo;s fingers actually trembled as she
took hold of the picture.</p>
<p>But all her hopes were dashed to pieces at the
first glance. The man was as different from
Mary Louise&rsquo;s burglar as anyone could possibly
be. Six feet tall and broad-shouldered, he was
smiling down tenderly at his new wife, who was
at least a foot shorter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s charming, Mrs. Weinberger,&rdquo; she tried
to say steadily. &ldquo;May I offer my congratulations?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The older woman straightened up&mdash;and actually
smiled!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_131">[131]</div>
<p>&ldquo;He is a civil engineer,&rdquo; she read proudly.
&ldquo;But he couldn&rsquo;t get a job, so he&rsquo;s driving a
taxi! Well, that&rsquo;s an honest living, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should say so!&rdquo; exclaimed Max. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re
lucky you don&rsquo;t have to support him&mdash;as so many
mothers and fathers-in-law have to nowadays.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary Louise was pleased for Mrs. Weinberger&rsquo;s
sake but disappointed for her own. Miss
Stoddard was all wrong: the solution was incorrect.
And she was just as much at sea as ever!</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s your friend Pauline Brooks,&rdquo; remarked
Mrs. Weinberger. &ldquo;And&mdash;look who&rsquo;s
with her!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a friend of hers&mdash;a Miss Jackson,&rdquo; explained
Mary Louise, as the two girls, with
their boy-friends, got up to dance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Jackson nothing! That&rsquo;s Mary Green&mdash;the
chorus girl who was staying at Stoddard
House when my watch was stolen. I&rsquo;d like to
have a talk with that young woman. But I suppose
it wouldn&rsquo;t do any good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary Louise&rsquo;s eyes narrowed until they were
only slits; she was thinking deeply. Mary Green&mdash;alias
Miss Jackson! The next step was to find
out whether Pauline Brooks too had a different
name at this hotel!</p>
<p>Maybe at last she was on the right track.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_132">[132]</div>
<h2 id="c10"><span class="small">CHAPTER X</span>
<br /><i>In the Dead of Night</i></h2>
<p>&ldquo;How about a movie?&rdquo; suggested Max, as the
young couple left the hotel dining room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh no, Max,&rdquo; replied Mary Louise. &ldquo;No,
thanks. I have to work now. I&rsquo;m going to stay
right here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the hotel? Doing what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some investigating.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You think that young man is guilty? He
looked honest to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t believe he&rsquo;s guilty. I&mdash;I&rsquo;ll
explain later, Max, if anything comes of my investigations....
Now, run along and do something
without me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can I see you tonight?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I could probably go to an early show with
you after dinner. I&rsquo;m not sure, so don&rsquo;t stay in
Philadelphia just on account of that. I mean, if
you want to start back home.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_133">[133]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to start home at daylight tomorrow,
morning,&rdquo; replied the young man. &ldquo;So I&rsquo;ll surely
be around tonight. At Stoddard House soon after
seven.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, I&rsquo;ll see you then. And thanks for a
lovely lunch, Max. It&rsquo;s been wonderful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young man departed, and Mary Louise
hunted a desk in one of the smaller rooms of the
Bellevue&mdash;set aside for writing. She placed a
sheet of paper in front of her and took up a
pen, as if she were writing a letter. But what she
really wanted to do was to think.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was wrong twice,&rdquo; she reasoned. &ldquo;First in
suspecting Miss Stoddard, then in believing
Miss Weinberger guilty. I&rsquo;ll go more carefully
this time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If my very first guess was right&mdash;that the
transient guests were stealing the valuables from
Stoddard House&mdash;I must begin all over again.
Mrs. Hilliard said there were two girls staying
at the hotel for a day or so when the silverware
and the vase were stolen.... Are these girls in
league with Mary Green and Pauline Brooks?
Are they all members of a secret band of thieves?
That&rsquo;s the first question I have to answer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She frowned and opened her notebook. Why
hadn&rsquo;t she gotten the names of those girls from
Mrs. Hilliard&rsquo;s old register?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_134">[134]</div>
<p>The second crime&mdash;the stealing of the watches&mdash;she
could pin on Mary Green, alias &ldquo;Blondie
Jackson.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now for the last three robberies. They had all
taken place while Pauline Brooks was at Stoddard
House!</p>
<p>Mary Louise considered them separately.
Pauline could have stolen Miss Granger&rsquo;s money
and her picture, but it was a man who entered
Mary Louise&rsquo;s bedroom on Friday night and
who took her watch and her money. Was one of
those young men whom Pauline was dining with
today an accomplice? If so, how did he escape
from the hotel? Out of Pauline&rsquo;s window?</p>
<p>Finally, she thought over the circumstances
of Mrs. Macgregor&rsquo;s robbery, and she almost
laughed out loud at her own stupidity. Pauline
had left her own room as soon as the maid came
in to clean it; she had slipped into Mrs. Macgregor&rsquo;s
room and stolen the bag containing the
valuables and had left the hotel immediately,
before Mrs. Macgregor came out of her bath.
Why hadn&rsquo;t she thought of that explanation before?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_135">[135]</div>
<p>The solution seemed logical and plausible, yet
how, Mary Louise asked herself, could she prove
her accusations? None of these girls had been
caught in the act; probably none of them still
possessed the stolen articles, and the money had
not been marked in any way or the serial numbers
taken.</p>
<p>This fact was dreadfully discouraging. If
Mary Louise could not prove the girls&rsquo; guilt,
she could do nothing about it. She couldn&rsquo;t even
assure Mrs. Hilliard that there would be no
more robberies at Stoddard House, because she
could not know how many members of this gang
there were, and the manager could not suspect
every transient guest who came to the hotel.</p>
<p>No, she concluded, there was nothing to do
but try to catch them in a new crime. If they
really made it their business to rob hotels, they
would probably carry out some plan here at the
Bellevue tonight. Mary Louise&rsquo;s only course was
to watch them.</p>
<p>With this determination in mind, she went to
the clerk&rsquo;s desk in the lobby.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Could I see the manager?&rdquo; she inquired.</p>
<p>The man looked at her quizzingly, wondering
whether Mary Louise was a patron of the
hotel or a society girl who wanted to collect
money for something.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you a guest at the hotel, miss?&rdquo; he asked.
&ldquo;Or have you an appointment?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_136">[136]</div>
<p>&ldquo;No to both questions,&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;But I
am a private detective, and I want to consult him
about something.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O.K.,&rdquo; agreed the clerk. &ldquo;What name,
please?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mary Louise Gay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The clerk reached for the telephone, and in
another minute he told Mary Louise where to
find the manager&rsquo;s office. She followed his directions
and walked in bravely, hoping that the
man would not think she was dreadfully young.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am staying at a small hotel for women
called Stoddard House,&rdquo; she began, &ldquo;to investigate
a series of robberies which they have had
there. The Philadelphia police have my name,
and if you wish to identify me, please call Mr.
LeStrange.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will take your word for it, Miss Gay,&rdquo; replied
the man, smiling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These robberies have always occurred when
there was a transient guest at the hotel,&rdquo; she explained.
&ldquo;The last series, while I was at the
place, led me to suspect a certain girl; the series
before that led other people to suspect another
girl. I find these two girls are living here now at
the Bellevue&mdash;they seem to go from one hotel
to another, for they were at the Ritz only last
Saturday. They evidently use different names. I
should like to meet your hotel detective, explain
the case to him, and get permission to watch
these two young women.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_137">[137]</div>
<p>The manager did not appear as surprised as
Mary Louise expected him to be. But she could
not know how common hotel robberies were at
the present time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will send for our detective,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You
have my permission to go ahead&mdash;under his
orders, of course.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, thank you!&rdquo; cried Mary Louise, delighted
that so far it had been easy.</p>
<p>The manager sent for the detective, a nice-looking
man of about thirty. He introduced him
as Mr. Hayden, and repeated Mary Louise&rsquo;s
story.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What would your plan be, Miss Gay?&rdquo; asked
the detective. He treated her respectfully, as if
she were indeed a real member of the profession,
and Mary Louise felt proud and happy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;First of all, I want to find these girls&rsquo; names
on the hotel register and see what names they
are using. Then I want, if possible, to engage a
room near theirs and listen for them all night.
And third, I want you, or one of your assistants,
Mr. Hayden, to be right there in readiness, in
case they do anything tonight.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_138">[138]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t evidence enough to convict them
of the robberies at Stoddard House?&rdquo; asked Mr.
Hayden.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh no. I may be entirely mistaken. It is only
a clue I am going on. But I believe it is worth
following up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you say, Hayden?&rdquo; inquired the
manager.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad to help,&rdquo; replied the younger man.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be on duty tonight, anyhow, and I&rsquo;d enjoy
the investigation. Nothing is lost, even if nothing
does happen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then let&rsquo;s go have a look at the register,&rdquo;
suggested Mary Louise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better send for it,&rdquo; said the detective.
&ldquo;Arouse no suspicions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The book was brought to them, and Mary
Louise looked carefully for the names of Pauline
Brooks and Mary Green. But she did not find
them. She did, however, find the name of Mary
Jackson, and with it a name of Catherine Smith,
both of whom had arrived that day and engaged
a room together on the sixth floor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those must be the girls,&rdquo; she concluded.
&ldquo;Room 607. What&rsquo;s the nearest room you can
give me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The manager looked in his records.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_139">[139]</div>
<p>&ldquo;609 is moving out tonight. Would that be
time enough&mdash;or do you want it now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, that&rsquo;s plenty of time. And another thing,
can you tell me where Mrs. Weinberger&rsquo;s room
is? I met her at Stoddard House, and she would
be a sort of chaperon for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Her room is on the tenth floor,&rdquo; was the
reply: &ldquo;1026.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks. Then put me down for 609, and I&rsquo;ll
phone Mrs. Weinberger this afternoon. I&rsquo;ll
come back early this evening, and I&rsquo;ll ask Mrs.
Weinberger to meet me in one of the reception
rooms. Then, could you come there too, Mr.
Hayden?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man nodded, smiling. How correct this
girl was about everything!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I believe it&rsquo;s all arranged,&rdquo; said Mary
Louise, rising. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go back to Stoddard House.
And if you have a chance, Mr. Hayden, will
you keep your eye on these girls we&rsquo;re suspecting?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t know them,&rdquo; he reminded her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d forgotten that! Well, let me describe
them. Maybe if you visit the sixth floor, you will
see them go in and out.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_140">[140]</div>
<p>She went on to tell him that Pauline Brooks&mdash;or
Catherine Smith, as she called herself here&mdash;was
a striking brunette, and that her companion,
Mary Green&mdash;or Mary Jackson&mdash;was
noticeably blond; that both girls were short
and slender and wore fur coats and expensive
jewelry; that both were as little like the typical
sneak thieves as could possibly be imagined.</p>
<p>As Mary Louise walked along the street she
decided not to tell Mrs. Hilliard any of the details
of her plans or who the girls were that she
was watching. If nothing came of her theory, she
would feel foolish at having failed the third
time. Besides, it wasn&rsquo;t fair to the girls to spread
suspicion about them until she had proved them
guilty.</p>
<p>She stopped at a jewelry store and purchased
a small, cheap watch, which she put into her
handbag. Then she went back to the hotel.</p>
<p>Immediately upon her arrival at Stoddard
House she called Mrs. Weinberger on the telephone;
then, assured of her co&ouml;peration, she
went to Mrs. Hilliard&rsquo;s office.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have decided to spend the night at the
Bellevue,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Mrs. Weinberger is going
to be my chaperon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The manager looked doubtful. &ldquo;But I promised
your father I&rsquo;d keep you right here with
me,&rdquo; she objected.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_141">[141]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I know, but this is important. I think I&rsquo;m
on the track of a discovery. And Mrs. Weinberger
has promised to look after me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does she know that you suspect her daughter,
Mary Louise?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, because I don&rsquo;t suspect her any longer.
Or her new husband either. My clues point in
another direction. This time I&rsquo;m not going to
say anything about them till I find out how they
work out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose it will be all right, then,&rdquo; agreed
Mrs. Hilliard reluctantly.... &ldquo;What are your
immediate plans, dear?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to sleep now till six o&rsquo;clock, because
it&rsquo;s possible I may be awake most of the
night. I&rsquo;ll have my dinner here with you then,
or with the Walder girls, and after that I&rsquo;m going
to a show with Max. About nine-thirty I&rsquo;ll
get to the Bellevue&mdash;Mrs. Weinberger is going
to wait up for me and go to my room with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid something may happen to you!&rdquo;
protested the good woman.</p>
<p>Mary Louise laughed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_142">[142]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Hilliard, you aren&rsquo;t a bit like an employer
to the detective she has hired. Instead,
you treat me like a daughter. And you mustn&rsquo;t.
I shan&rsquo;t be a bit of use to you if you don&rsquo;t help
me go ahead and work hard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose you&rsquo;re right, Mary Louise,&rdquo; sighed
Mrs. Hilliard. &ldquo;But I had no idea what a lovable
child you were when I told your father I
didn&rsquo;t mind hiring anybody so young as long as
she got results.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I only hope I do!&rdquo; exclaimed Mary Louise
fervently.</p>
<p>She went to her own room, packed only her
toilet articles in her handbag&mdash;for she had no
intention of going to bed that night&mdash;and lay
down for her nap. It was dark when she awakened.</p>
<p>Dressing hurriedly, and taking her hat and
coat with her, she met the Walder girls in the
lobby and accepted their invitation to eat dinner
with them. Immediately afterwards Max
arrived at the hotel, and the young couple went
directly to a movie.</p>
<p>When it was over, the young man suggested
that they go somewhere to eat and dance.</p>
<p>Mary Louise shook her head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, Max&mdash;I&rsquo;d like to, but I can&rsquo;t. This
is all I can be with you tonight. I want you to
take me to the Bellevue now. I&rsquo;m spending the
night there.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_143">[143]</div>
<p>&ldquo;What in thunder are you doing that for?&rdquo;
he stormed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please calm down, Max!&rdquo; she begged. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
perfectly all right: Mrs. Weinberger is going
to meet me and look after me. But I&rsquo;d rather
you didn&rsquo;t say anything about it to Mother&mdash;I
can explain better when I get home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Still, I don&rsquo;t like it,&rdquo; he muttered.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, he took her to the hotel and
waited with her until Mrs. Weinberger came
downstairs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t forget to be back home for the dance a
week from tonight, Mary Lou!&rdquo; he said at parting.</p>
<p>Mary Louise turned to Mrs. Weinberger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you seen the girls&mdash;Pauline Brooks and
Mary Green?&rdquo; she asked. She had explained
over the telephone why she wanted to stay at
the Bellevue.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I haven&rsquo;t,&rdquo; replied the older woman.
&ldquo;But then, I have been in my own room.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How late do you expect to stay up tonight,
Mrs. Weinberger?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Till about eleven, I suppose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you bring your knitting or your magazine
to my room till you&rsquo;re ready to go to bed?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_144">[144]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly&mdash;I&rsquo;ll be glad to have your company,
my dear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Hayden, the hotel detective, stepped out
of the elevator and came to join them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a sitting room on the sixth floor,&rdquo; he
said. &ldquo;Suppose I go there about midnight, Miss
Gay? I&rsquo;m going to have a nap now, but my assistant
is in charge, and if you need him, notify
the desk, and he&rsquo;ll be with you immediately. Is
that O.K.?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perfectly satisfactory,&rdquo; agreed Mary Louise.</p>
<p>Taking the key to her room, she and Mrs.
Weinberger went up together.</p>
<p>Pauline&rsquo;s room was apparently dark, but
Mary Louise left her own door open so that
Mrs. Weinberger could watch for the girls. She
herself took up a position where she could not
be seen from the doorway. She turned on the
room radio, and a couple of hours passed pleasantly.</p>
<p>At eleven o&rsquo;clock Mrs. Weinberger decided to
go to her own room and go to bed. When she had
gone, Mary Louise turned off the light and the
radio and closed her door. Pulling a comfortable
chair close beside the keyhole, she sat down
to wait and to listen for Pauline&rsquo;s and Mary&rsquo;s
return.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_145">[145]</div>
<p>The elevators clicked more frequently as midnight
approached; more and more guests returned
to their rooms. Mary Louise watched
them all until she saw Pauline Brooks and Mary
Green come along the passageway. They were
in high spirits, laughing and talking noisily
without any regard for the sleepers in the hotel.
Even through the thick walls, Mary Louise
could hear them as they prepared for bed.</p>
<p>But in half an hour all was quiet. Both girls
were asleep, no doubt&mdash;and Mary Louise believed
that she had had all her trouble for nothing.
She sighed and dozed in her chair.</p>
<p>However, she was not used to sleeping sitting
up, and every little noise in the hall aroused
her attention. She heard a man come along at
two o&rsquo;clock, and another at half-past. And a
little after three she identified the muffled sound
of the door of the next room opening!</p>
<p>Leaning forward tensely, she glued her eye
to the keyhole. Two young men emerged from
the girls&rsquo; room and staggered about unsteadily,
as if they were drunk. Two very small men, who
somehow looked more like masqueraders than
real men, although they were correctly dressed,
except for the fact that they wore their caps instead
of hats and had not taken them off in the
hotel.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_146">[146]</div>
<p>In spite of their apparently intoxicated condition
they walked silently across the hall to
room 614. Very cautiously one of them took a
key from his pocket, and after a moment or two,
he opened the door. Both young men entered the
room, but Mary Louise saw that they did not
turn on the light as they went in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s something queer about that,&rdquo; she
thought. And then she remembered the burglar
who had entered her own room at Stoddard
House and had stolen her watch. He was very
like these young men&mdash;short and slight and wore
a cap. Perhaps these were Pauline&rsquo;s accomplices!</p>
<p>Cautiously she moved her chair aside and
slipped out of her room. In another moment she
had reached the sitting room where Mr. Hayden,
the detective, was dozing over a newspaper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come with me!&rdquo; she said briefly, leading
him to room 614. &ldquo;I saw two young men enter
this room a couple of minutes ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The detective knocked gently on the door.
There was no reply. He knocked again.</p>
<p>The startled voice of a man called out, &ldquo;What
do you want?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_147">[147]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m the hotel detective,&rdquo; answered Mr. Hayden.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry to disturb you, but please open
the door.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A light flashed on in the room, and an elderly
man, now clad in his dressing gown, admitted
Mary Louise and Mr. Hayden.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This young lady thinks she saw two young
men come in here five minutes ago,&rdquo; explained
the latter. &ldquo;Were you asleep, sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; was the reply. &ldquo;Your knock waked me
up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, if you don&rsquo;t mind, we&rsquo;ll search the
room. Have you anything valuable here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I certainly have! A wallet with five hundred
dollars, and a set of diamond shirt studs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Hayden went straight to the closet and
turned on the light. Feminine giggles greeted
his action.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo; be mad at us, mishter!&rdquo; pleaded a girl&rsquo;s
voice. &ldquo;We jus&rsquo; had a leetle too mush likker, and
we wanted to get some shirt studs for our costumes.
We&rsquo;re goin&rsquo; to a nish party, dreshed up
like men!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Hayden smiled and pulled out the two
&ldquo;young men&rdquo; from the closet. As he snatched off
their caps, Mary Louise recognized them instantly.
Pauline Brooks and Mary Green!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_148">[148]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Pauline!&rdquo; she cried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Emmy Lou!&rdquo; In her surprise, Pauline forgot
to act drunk. But the next moment she remembered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pleash let us go, mishter,&rdquo; she pleaded, taking
hold of Mr. Hayden&rsquo;s coat collar. &ldquo;Was only
jus&rsquo; a prank&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Prank nothing!&rdquo; cried Mary Louise. &ldquo;And
these girls aren&rsquo;t intoxicated, either, Mr. Hayden.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t believe they are,&rdquo; agreed the detective.
He turned to the owner of the room.
&ldquo;Suppose you check up on your valuables, sir,
while I call the police.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not going to send us to jail!&rdquo; protested
Pauline, in a perfectly normal tone. &ldquo;But
we haven&rsquo;t stolen anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You stole plenty at Stoddard House,&rdquo; Mary
Louise couldn&rsquo;t help saying.</p>
<p>Pauline regarded her accuser with hatred in
her eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you&rsquo;re the one who&rsquo;s responsible for this!&rdquo;
she hissed. &ldquo;Nasty little rat! And I thought you
were a friend of mine!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary Louise laughed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_149">[149]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be a friend when you and your gang give
back all the stolen articles and money,&rdquo; she
replied.</p>
<p>The elderly man who lived in the room interrupted
them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two studs are missing,&rdquo; he announced. &ldquo;I
found the wallet with my money in it on the
floor. Yet it was carefully put away last night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take off your shoes, Pauline!&rdquo; ordered
Mary Louise. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the place to find missing
diamonds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl had to obey, and the studs fell out
on the floor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s enough,&rdquo; concluded Mr. Hayden. &ldquo;Here
comes my assistant. You girls will come with us
till the police arrive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not in these clothes!&rdquo; objected Mary Green.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, just as you are.&rdquo; He turned to the man.
&ldquo;And now, good-night, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good-night, and thank you a thousand
times!&rdquo; was the reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank Miss Gay,&rdquo; amended Mr. Hayden.
&ldquo;It was her work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tired but satisfied, Mary Louise went back
to her own room, and, removing only her shoes
and her dress, she slept soundly for the rest of
the night.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_150">[150]</div>
<h2 id="c11"><span class="small">CHAPTER XI</span>
<br /><i>Bail</i></h2>
<p>Mary Louise did not awaken until nine o&rsquo;clock
the following morning. A pleasant glow of triumph
suffused her; she was experiencing her
first thrill of professional success. But the occurrence
of the preceding night was only a partial
victory, she reminded herself; the job was
just begun. There were more thieves to be
caught, and valuables to be recovered.</p>
<p>She decided to ring for a breakfast tray in
her room. She had often seen this luxury pictured
in the movies; now was her chance to try it
out for herself. While it was being prepared she
took a shower and dressed.</p>
<p>Ten minutes later the tempting meal arrived.
It was fun, she thought, as she poured the coffee
from the silver pot, to play being a wealthy lady,
but it would be more enjoyable if Jane were with
her.... However, she had no time now to
think of Jane or of her friends in Riverside; she
must concentrate all her mental powers upon
the mystery she was trying to solve.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_151">[151]</div>
<p>These were the hypotheses she meant to build
her case upon:</p>
<p>1. Pauline Brooks and Mary Green were two
members of a secret band of hotel robbers, composed
probably of women and girls.</p>
<p>2. Pauline&rsquo;s &ldquo;aunt,&rdquo; as she called her, must
be the leader, since she went from hotel to hotel.</p>
<p>3. The two transient guests who had undoubtedly
stolen the silverware and the vase from
Stoddard House were members of the same
gang.</p>
<p>4. Pauline&rsquo;s &ldquo;aunt&rdquo; had a country place where
she probably hid the stolen articles until they
could be disposed of.</p>
<p>Now, with these facts in mind, Mary Louise
had several poignant questions to answer:</p>
<p>1. Was this country place at Center Square,
and was that woman whom Mary Louise had
seen in the dark Pauline&rsquo;s aunt?</p>
<p>2. Was Margaret Detweiler connected with
this gang?</p>
<p>Mary Louise remembered that Mary Green
had admitted that she knew Margaret and that
Pauline had instantly contradicted her.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_152">[152]</div>
<p>It was still rather a muddle, she decided as
she finished her breakfast and left the room.
She took the elevator to Mrs. Weinberger&rsquo;s floor
and hastily told her the story of the previous
night&rsquo;s excitement; then, scarcely waiting for the
older woman&rsquo;s congratulations, she hurried
down to the manager&rsquo;s office.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The hotel is exceedingly grateful to you for
the service you have rendered us, Miss Gay,&rdquo;
said the man. &ldquo;The least we can do is to present
you with a receipted bill for your room and
breakfast.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary Louise gasped out her thanks: she had
never dreamed of a reward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what became of the girls?&rdquo; she inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are being held under five hundred dollars
bail,&rdquo; was the reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They won&rsquo;t have any trouble raising that,
I&rsquo;m afraid,&rdquo; said Mary Louise. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ll skip
and go right on with their old tricks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps you&rsquo;re right, Miss Gay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is Mr. Hayden here?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, he has gone home,&rdquo; replied the manager.
&ldquo;But he left this memorandum for you in case
you want to visit the girls and see whether you
can learn anything more about the case you&rsquo;re
working on.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_153">[153]</div>
<p>Mary Louise put the paper with the address
on it in her handbag and hurried back to Stoddard
House. She found Mrs. Hilliard in her office
on the first floor, planning her work for the
day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve great news for you, Mrs. Hilliard!&rdquo; she
cried, carefully closing the door behind her.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve caught two of the thieves, and you&rsquo;ll never
guess who they are!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I won&rsquo;t even try,&rdquo; returned the other.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not much good as a detective. But hurry
up and tell me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pauline Brooks and Mary Green!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pauline Brooks!&rdquo; repeated Mrs. Hilliard in
amazement. &ldquo;But tell me how you know!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The detective at the Bellevue and I caught
them in men&rsquo;s clothing, trying to rob another
guest at the hotel. Remember&mdash;I thought it was
a man who stole my watch, though he did seem
awfully small? Well, it was Pauline, and she
was dressed up the same way last night!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re the cleverest girl I ever met, Mary
Louise! How did you ever come to suspect those
girls?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_154">[154]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you the whole story later&mdash;when I
have more time, Mrs. Hilliard. I&rsquo;ve got to be
off now, after some evidence to prove that they
were the thieves who did the stealing here. You
see, they&rsquo;re in jail now for what they did at the
Bellevue, but I have nothing to prove they were
guilty of the robberies at Stoddard House.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what are you going to do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to try to find the leader of their
gang and find the treasure chest. And that reminds
me, I want the names of those two transients
who were here when you missed the vase
and the silverware.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Hilliard searched for them in her book,
and Mary Louise copied them, although she had
little hope that they would help her. The way
these girls changed names with each change of
residence made it extremely baffling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where do you expect to look for the leader
of this gang?&rdquo; asked the manager.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to drive up to Center Square
again, right now. In a hired &lsquo;drive it yourself&rsquo;
car.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t that where you got that blow on your
head?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but you needn&rsquo;t worry about me this
time, Mrs. Hilliard. I&rsquo;m going to get a policeman
to go with me to the empty house.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_155">[155]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Wise girl.... But I believe you&rsquo;d be wiser
still, Mary Louise, if you just dropped the thing
now and went home for Christmas. You&rsquo;ve certainly
earned your pay, and we can feel that
our troubles are over. I can give the guests some
assurance that they will not be robbed again.
Won&rsquo;t you go, dear? Your family will be wanting
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh no, Mrs. Hilliard&mdash;thank you just the
same. But I couldn&rsquo;t think of it. I want to recover
the stolen goods and get more proof
against those two girls. I couldn&rsquo;t give up now!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then, be very careful!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be back in time for supper,&rdquo; she
promised.</p>
<p>Mary Louise went directly to the nearest
agency and hired a car. Not a new car, but one
which ran smoothly and which she found no
difficulty in operating. The day was warm for
December, and sunny; the snow was gone; it
would be jolly to spend the whole day out-of-doors.
Of course, it would have been nicer if
Jane or Max were with her, but Mary Louise
had so much to think about that she did not
mind being alone.</p>
<p>Wasn&rsquo;t it funny, she mused, that the very first
guest she had met at Stoddard House had been
the guilty person? How thankful she was that
she had not given in to that impulse to make
Pauline Brooks her confidante! Perhaps, if she
had, Pauline would not have stolen her watch.
Yet, without that misfortune, Mary Louise
might never have solved the mystery.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_156">[156]</div>
<p>She drove along at an even speed, following
her map and watching for the landmarks she
had noticed on her previous trip. About noon
she arrived at the hotel where she and Max had
eaten dinner on Sunday evening, and she drew
the car to a stop at its entrance.</p>
<p>The same clerk was at the desk; he remembered
Mary Louise and asked immediately how
her head was.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s almost well,&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;But I want
to visit that house again and find out who lives
there and what hit me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To collect damages?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, not specially. But there is something
mysterious about that house, and I&rsquo;d like to see
it in broad daylight. This time I want to take
a policeman with me. Have you any in Center
Square?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have a constable. He might be willing
to go along.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would you be kind enough to ring him up
and ask him to come here while I eat my lunch
in the dining room? After all, he has a right to
help me find out what hit me.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_157">[157]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, I will, miss. And he&rsquo;ll be glad to come.
He&rsquo;s mighty obliging. Besides, he ain&rsquo;t got much
to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary Louise was hungry, and she enjoyed
her lunch immensely. The food wasn&rsquo;t dainty
like the Stoddard House, or fancy, like the Bellevue,
but it was wholesome and well cooked,
and the keen air had given her a good appetite.</p>
<p>When she had finished eating and returned
to the main room of the little country hotel, she
found the officer waiting for her. He was a
stout, middle-aged man with a pleasant smile,
and he wore a baggy gray suit with a stringy tie.
He was very much interested in the story of
Mary Louise&rsquo;s previous visit to Center Square,
and of her reason for wanting to see the ugly
woman again who was occupying the house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, what I&rsquo;m hoping for,&rdquo; concluded
Mary Louise, &ldquo;is to catch her with the stolen
goods and have her arrested. But she may not
be the person I&rsquo;m looking for at all, because I
saw her in the dark with only a lighted candle
behind her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is her name?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Brooks is the only name I know her
by. But I&rsquo;ve learned that criminals have half a
dozen names, so you can&rsquo;t go by that. There isn&rsquo;t
anybody by that name around here, is there?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_158">[158]</div>
<p>The man shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, there ain&rsquo;t. But let&rsquo;s drive to the house
you mean, and I can tell you who owns it. And
maybe tell you something about the people that
live there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe anybody really lives there,&rdquo;
replied Mary Louise. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all boarded up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They got into Mary Louise&rsquo;s hired car, and
she turned off the main highway into the dirt
road which she and Max had explored. Here it
was difficult for Mary Louise to find her way,
because on the former occasion it had been dark,
and snow had covered most of the ground. She
drove along slowly, past the empty house they
had first visited, until she came to the hill and
the place with the steep driveway. She remembered
the house now; there was the tree under
which Max had parked, and the barn beyond.
A huge sign bearing the words &ldquo;No Trespassing&mdash;Private
Property&rdquo; had been erected since her
former visit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This place belongs to a Mrs. Ferguson of
Baltimore,&rdquo; announced the constable. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s a
widow with two daughters. They never live
here, but once in a while she brings a bunch of
girls here for a house party. She&rsquo;s wealthy&mdash;always
comes in a car and brings a couple of servants.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_159">[159]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Ferguson,&rdquo; repeated Mary Louise, wondering
where she had heard that name before. But
she had heard so many new names in the past
few days that she could not place it. &ldquo;Could you
describe her?&rdquo; she inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t say as I could. Never saw her close.
She dresses stylish, I know that, and has nothin&rsquo;
to do with the country folks around here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary Louise brought the car to a stop and
parked it some distance from the house, cautiously
avoiding the trees this time. Even though
she had a constable with her, she wasn&rsquo;t taking
any chances of being hit again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the tree we were parked under,&rdquo; she
pointed out, &ldquo;where I got hit in the head.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you see anybody?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. But my friend said afterward he heard
somebody laugh. But he couldn&rsquo;t wait to investigate,
because he had to get me to a doctor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe it was just a bad boy. We have some
young bums around here once in a while.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary Louise got out of the car, and the constable
followed her, making a tour of the outside
of the house, examining the boarded windows,
trying the locked doors. Apparently it was deserted.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_160">[160]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d love to get inside,&rdquo; remarked Mary
Louise. &ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t we break in?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not without a warrant,&rdquo; replied the officer.
&ldquo;We ain&rsquo;t got any real evidence against this lady.
You can&rsquo;t tell what hit you, and besides, you was
trespassin&rsquo; on private property.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary Louise sighed. Evidently there was
nothing she could do here. She might as well go
back to Philadelphia.</p>
<p>It had been rather a useless waste of time, she
thought, as she drove along towards the hotel.
She had learned only one fact&mdash;the name of the
owner of that empty house. &ldquo;Ferguson,&rdquo; she kept
repeating to herself, wondering where she had
heard that name before. And then it came to her&mdash;in
a flash. Ferguson was the name of the
woman who had helped Margaret Detweiler at
the department store!</p>
<p>Mary Louise laughed out loud.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So I&rsquo;m on the track of the wrong mystery,&rdquo;
she thought. &ldquo;Oh, well, if I could find Margaret
Detweiler I&rsquo;d be happier than if I got back all
that money stolen from Stoddard House. So my
day really hasn&rsquo;t been wasted.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_161">[161]</div>
<p>When she arrived at her hotel she literally
smelled Christmas in the air. The windows were
hung with wreaths; holly and mistletoe and
evergreen decorated the rooms on the first floor.
Everybody seemed to be hurrying around with a
pleasant holiday air of excitement, carrying
packages and making last-minute plans for the
great day.</p>
<p>A sudden swift feeling of homesickness took
possession of Mary Louise, a violent desire to be
back in her own home in Riverside, sharing the
happy holiday confusion. For a moment she felt
that she would have to go back at any sacrifice.
But ambition overcame sentiment. She would
not be a quitter, and leave at the most important
time. She would see the thing through as she
had planned.</p>
<p>But there was nothing to prevent her wiring
to her father to come and spend part of the holiday
with her. Especially now that she had something
definite to report to him. So she composed
a telegram and sent it at once, over the telephone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have caught thieves,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;but cannot
recover stolen goods. Leader of band at large.
Please come help me. Love&mdash;M.L.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_162">[162]</div>
<p>As soon as the message was sent, she felt better
and was as jolly as anyone else at supper. She
was helping the Walder girls tie up packages
and humming Christmas carols when a call came
for her on the telephone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe it&rsquo;s Dad,&rdquo; she said to Mrs. Hilliard
as she came into the manager&rsquo;s office.</p>
<p>But it wasn&rsquo;t. It was Mr. Hayden, calling
from the Bellevue.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pauline Brooks has wired to a Mrs. Ferguson,
Hotel Phillips, Baltimore, Maryland,&rdquo; he
announced, &ldquo;asking for five hundred dollars.
All she says in her telegram is: &lsquo;Please send
$500 bail,&rsquo; and signed it &lsquo;P.B.&rsquo; But I thought it
might help you to know to whom she wired,
Miss Gay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should say it does!&rdquo; exclaimed Mary
Louise rapturously. &ldquo;Thank you so much, Mr.
Hayden!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was so happy that she executed a dance.
Oh, how wonderful that piece of news was! Mrs.
Ferguson! The woman who had helped&mdash;or pretended
to help&mdash;Margaret Detweiler! The
woman who lived at Center Square! Possibly&mdash;the
same woman whom Pauline had called her
aunt, by the name of Mrs. Brooks!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_163">[163]</div>
<p>Everything seemed to be coming untangled
all at once. If only Mary Louise could catch this
Ferguson woman! But of course she could&mdash;with
her father&rsquo;s help. Thank heaven he would
be coming soon! He could fly straight to Baltimore
and accomplish her arrest. And the mystery&mdash;perhaps
both mysteries&mdash;would be solved!</p>
<p>So Mary Louise went happily to sleep that
night, little dreaming that the worst part of her
experience lay ahead of her.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_164">[164]</div>
<h2 id="c12"><span class="small">CHAPTER XII</span>
<br /><i>Detective Gay Arrives</i></h2>
<p>Mary Louise awakened the following morning
with a delightful sense of expectancy. It was the
day before Christmas! Surely her father would
come; he would know how much she wanted
him, and her mother would be unselfish enough
to urge him to go. He would bring Mary Louise
her Christmas presents and take her out to
Christmas dinner.</p>
<p>She dressed quickly and hurried down to the
lobby to ask the secretary whether there was any
message for her. None had arrived as yet, but by
the time she had finished her breakfast it came.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Arrive about noon to stay over Christmas
with you. Love&mdash;Dad,&rdquo; were the precious words
she read.</p>
<p>Her eyes sparkling with anticipation, Mary
Louise ran to Mrs. Hilliard with her good news.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you see I don&rsquo;t need to go home,&rdquo; she said.
&ldquo;I can hardly wait till he comes!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_165">[165]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so glad, dear,&rdquo; replied the manager.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been an awfully good sport about being
away from your family&mdash;and now you&rsquo;re getting
your reward.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I&rsquo;ll put in my time till he arrives by
going over to visit my friend Pauline Brooks,&rdquo;
said Mary Louise. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to find out whether
she obtained her bail yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You better be careful,&rdquo; warned Mrs. Hilliard.
&ldquo;That girl probably hates you now, and if
she&rsquo;s free there&rsquo;s no telling what she might do to
you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know she hates me. But she can&rsquo;t do a
thing. Especially with guards all around....
And I&rsquo;ll be back before Dad comes. I want to
be on the spot to greet him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She put on her hat and coat and went to the
address which Mr. Hayden had written down
for her on the paper. She encountered no difficulty
in finding her way to the matron who had
charge of the women prisoners.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am Mary Louise Gay,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;A private
detective in the employ of the manager of
Stoddard House. I believe that two of your prisoners&mdash;Pauline
Brooks and Mary Green&mdash;are
guilty of some robberies there, as well as at the
Bellevue, where they were caught. But I haven&rsquo;t
evidence enough to prove my case. I thought if
I might talk to these girls&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_166">[166]</div>
<p>The matron interrupted her. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t do
that, Miss Gay,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;because they have already
been released on bail, until their case
comes up next month.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did they get the money&mdash;it was five
hundred dollars, wasn&rsquo;t it?&mdash;so soon?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They wired yesterday to a Mrs. Ferguson in
Baltimore. Miss Brooks received a registered
letter this morning, and the girls left half an
hour ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary Louise sighed; it seemed as if she were
always too late. Why hadn&rsquo;t she come here before
breakfast, since she knew from Mr. Hayden
last night that the girls had telegraphed a
request for the money?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where did they go?&rdquo; was her next question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. They are to report back here
on the morning of January second&mdash;or forfeit
their bail.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They won&rsquo;t be back,&rdquo; announced Mary
Louise. &ldquo;Five hundred dollars is nothing to
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The matron turned to read a letter; she had no
more time to discuss the subject with the young
detective. But Mary Louise lingered.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_167">[167]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I just want to ask one more question,&rdquo; she
said; &ldquo;and then I won&rsquo;t take any more of your
time. Was there a letter from this Mrs. Ferguson,
or did she merely send the money?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There was a letter. I had it copied, because
Mr. Hayden told me to keep copies of any correspondence
these girls had while they were here....
Wait a minute&mdash;yes, here it is. You may
read it for yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary Louise took the copy eagerly and read
it as quickly as she could. The writing was poor
but entirely legible, and the words were spelled
right. But the subject matter was so rambling
that in certain places she was not sure that she
read it correctly. This was the letter which she
finally deciphered:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><i>Dear Girls:</i></p>
<p><i>You poor girls! Meet your misfortune with
this $500. U.S. justice is terrible! In what other
country would they detain innocent girls?</i></p>
<p><i>Baltimore is where I am now, but I am leaving
immediately for a trip to Florida. Margaret
can&rsquo;t go with me on account of school. Will you
write to her? Get her address from the phone
book.</i></p>
<p><i>Treasure Island is playing at the movies, and
we liked it a lot. From my observation it is like
the book. C.S. enjoyed it thoroughly. And so did
I. Bring me back the book if you go home for
Christmas. It was mine anyhow.</i></p>
<p><i>Tonight I am packing. Baltimore is tiresome,
and I&rsquo;ll be glad to leave.</i></p>
<p><span class="jr"><i>Love,</i></span>
<span class="jr"><i>Aunt Ethel.</i></span></p>
</blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_168">[168]</div>
<p>&ldquo;May I make another copy of this letter?&rdquo;
Mary Louise asked the matron. Since it was
rather peculiar, it would bear studying. Besides,
it mentioned Margaret, and that might mean
Margaret Detweiler.</p>
<p>The matron agreed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sit down at that desk. Or do you want a
typewriter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, if you can lend me one,&rdquo; answered
Mary Louise. She had learned typing at school,
thinking it would come in handy in her chosen
profession.</p>
<p>So she typed the letter carefully and put it
into her handbag.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_169">[169]</div>
<p>As she stepped out into the open air again she
saw by one of the big clocks on the street that it
was only a little past ten. Two hours to wait
until she saw her father! Two hours, with nothing
to do. It seemed rather ridiculous that she
should be so idle when everybody else was apparently
so busy. The throngs of people on the
streets rushed along as if there were not a minute
to lose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can go in here and buy some handkerchiefs
for Mrs. Hilliard for Christmas,&rdquo; she thought,
as she entered a department store. All the rest of
her gifts had been bought and wrapped up long
ago; they were piled neatly in a box at home,
ready for her mother to distribute to her family
and her friends on Christmas morning.</p>
<p>The organ in the store was playing Christmas
music; Mary Louise lingered for a while after
she made her purchase to listen to it. She felt
very happy because her father was coming.</p>
<p>She returned to the hotel about eleven, put
Mrs. Hilliard&rsquo;s gift on her desk and went down
to one of the reception rooms to wait for her
father. The Walder girls came in&mdash;they both
had a half holiday so that they might start home
early&mdash;and they said good-bye to Mary Louise
and wished her a merry Christmas.</p>
<p>The slow hands of the clock crept towards
twelve. At five minutes of the hour her father
came.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_170">[170]</div>
<p>Mary Louise saw him the minute he opened
the door and rushed to him as if it had been
years, and not days, since their parting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Dad, this is grand!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;I was so
afraid you wouldn&rsquo;t be able to get here. Are you
very busy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, dear,&rdquo; he replied as he kissed her.
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a sort of lull in my work now, and I
had expected to be home for several days. But
now I am at your service. Your aunt arrived
yesterday to be with your mother over the holidays,
so they probably won&rsquo;t miss me much. I
want you to tell me everything that has happened
so far. Max said your watch was stolen,
and you were hit on the head by a stone. How is
your head now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right, Daddy. And I bought a cheap
watch, so I can get along without my good one,
though of course I was especially fond of it. But
come into the dining room and let&rsquo;s have lunch
while we talk. At least, if you don&rsquo;t mind being
the only man with a lot of women. Max objected
to that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t mind,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;And I am hungry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When they were seated at one of the small
tables and had given their orders, Mary Louise
began to tell her story.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_171">[171]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I was robbed that very first night,&rdquo; she said.
&ldquo;Of course, it was pretty dark in my room, but
not terribly so, for the street lights show up quite
well. Anyhow, I could see well enough to distinguish
a small man, with a cap and a black
mask.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we had a watchman on guard that
night, and the police got here in no time, but nobody
saw the burglar get away. I insisted he was
hiding in the hotel, but Mrs. Hilliard had it
searched thoroughly, and we couldn&rsquo;t find a man
in the place. I didn&rsquo;t dream then that it was a
girl masquerading as a man. But that is the explanation:
a girl named Pauline Brooks, who
lived right across the hall from me. Of course, it
was the easiest thing in the world for her to slip
back into her own room and take off her disguise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you search for the burglar in her room
too?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, we went there the very first thing. Pauline
made us wait a minute or two&mdash;she said she
had just gotten in from a dance and was half
undressed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you believed her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, indeed. We had become quite good
friends at supper that night.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_172">[172]</div>
<p>Mr. Gay laughed. &ldquo;But what finally led you
to suspect her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary Louise went on to tell her father in detail
about her false suspicions concerning first
Miss Stoddard and then Miss Weinberger, and
described her visit to the Bellevue and the catching
of Pauline Brooks and Mary Green in the
very act of stealing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But that wasn&rsquo;t evidence enough to prove
them guilty of the robberies at Stoddard
House,&rdquo; objected her father.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; admitted Mary Louise. &ldquo;But I figured
out that there is a whole band of these
secret hotel thieves, for I&rsquo;m pretty sure two other
members stole some silverware and a vase from
Stoddard House a while ago. I believe, too, that
a woman whom Pauline called her aunt is the
leader.... And that&rsquo;s what I want you to do,
Dad. Go after her!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But where is she?&rdquo; he demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think she&rsquo;s in Baltimore now, at the Hotel
Phillips, because that&rsquo;s where the girls got their
money for bail. Five hundred dollars. She&rsquo;s
planning to go to Florida, so you have to hurry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What could I do with her if I did find her?&rdquo;
inquired Mr. Gay.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t you arrest her?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_173">[173]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Not unless I had some evidence against her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary Louise sighed: it was dreadful, she
thought, to know that somebody was guilty and
not be able to prove it. But she could see that her
father was right.</p>
<p>Mr. Gay was enjoying his lunch. He praised
the food and the service to Mary Louise and exclaimed
in surprise that the hotel was not well
filled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s partly because of these robberies,&rdquo; explained
Mary Louise. &ldquo;Several people have
moved out just since I came. No wonder Mrs.
Hilliard is worried.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But she feels encouraged since you found
two of the thieves, doesn&rsquo;t she?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, she&rsquo;s tremendously pleased. She told
me I had earned my money, and I could go
home. But of course I&rsquo;m not satisfied. The job&rsquo;s
only half done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The waitress approached the table, and offered
a menu.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take plum pudding,&rdquo; announced Mr.
Gay, &ldquo;in celebration of the season. How about
you, Mary Lou?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Chocolate sundae,&rdquo; was her inevitable
choice.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_174">[174]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Where,&rdquo; inquired Mr. Gay, turning to his
daughter, &ldquo;did this aunt of Pauline&rsquo;s live when
she was in Philadelphia?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She stayed at the Ritz.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never at Stoddard House?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh no.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then we&rsquo;ll make a visit to the Ritz after
lunch. And I think I will take the two o&rsquo;clock
train to Baltimore to see what I can find out
about the woman. What does she call herself?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Ferguson&mdash;and sometimes Mrs.
Brooks. Possibly there are two different women,
but I don&rsquo;t believe so.... But what will you
do at the Ritz, Daddy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just make inquiries as to whether anything
was stolen while the woman stayed there, and if
so, what. That would give me a reason for going
after her in Baltimore.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a great idea, Dad!&rdquo; exclaimed Mary
Louise joyfully. &ldquo;May I go to the hotel with
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course. Now, you run along and get your
hat and coat and tell Mrs. Hilliard where you
are going, while I order a taxi.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_175">[175]</div>
<p>It was not until they were in the cab that Mr.
Gay remembered to ask how Mary Louise had
received the cut on her head. Max had not told
him much, he explained, because he wanted to
keep it secret from Mary Louise&rsquo;s mother, to
save her unnecessary worry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was part of my investigation about Margaret
Detweiler,&rdquo; replied the girl, and she hurriedly
told her father the reason for her visit to
Center Square and its consequences. &ldquo;But I feel
that in some way the two cases are tied up together,&rdquo;
she added, &ldquo;for the woman who owns
the place is named Mrs. Ferguson, and a face
which I saw at the window reminded me of the
woman Pauline called her aunt. But it&rsquo;s all very
confusing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The taxi pulled up at the Ritz, and Mr. Gay
and his daughter got out. With his badge, the
former had no difficulty in interviewing the
hotel detective immediately. He asked whether
any money or valuables had been lost at the Ritz
during the past week.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied the other, &ldquo;some money and a
valuable bag containing two pearl rings were
stolen last Friday. But we suspected a chap who
called himself a traveling salesman, and we&rsquo;re
on his track.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was a Mrs. Brooks staying here at the time?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. I remember her well. With two nieces.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please describe her,&rdquo; urged Mary Louise.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_176">[176]</div>
<p>&ldquo;She is tall and stout&mdash;weighs around a hundred
and eighty, I should judge. About fifty
years old, with black hair done very severely&mdash;looks
like a wig. Dresses well and wears jewelry.
Has false teeth and an ugly mouth, but seems a
great favorite with young people.... That&rsquo;s
about all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s enough,&rdquo; said Mr. Gay. &ldquo;Now, can
you tell me just what was stolen?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The detective wrote down the articles on a
slip of paper. &ldquo;A bag containing two pearl rings,
and two hundred dollars.&rdquo; The bag was valuable
in itself, being made of gold mesh, he told
them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you very much,&rdquo; said Mr. Gay as he
pocketed the list. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll let you know if I have
any success.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The taxi was waiting outside the hotel, and
Mary Louise jumped into it first.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll ride to the station with you, Daddy,&rdquo; she
said. &ldquo;Do you think you&rsquo;ll be back tonight?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;But we&rsquo;ll have a fine
Christmas together tomorrow.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_177">[177]</div>
<p>He was just in time to catch his train. Mary
Louise watched it pull out of the station and
wondered what in the world she would do to
pass the afternoon. Slowly she walked out to the
street and looked at the Christmas displays in
the shop windows.</p>
<p>She had gone about two blocks when she
stopped to examine a particularly attractive
display, featuring a small, real Christmas tree,
when she noticed that the shop into whose window
she was gazing was a tea room. A cup of
hot chocolate ought to taste good, she decided&mdash;rich
and hot, with whipped cream on the top!
So she opened the door and went inside.</p>
<p>Little did she realize at that moment how
thankful she was to be later on for that one cup
of chocolate and the plate of little cakes that she
ordered!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_178">[178]</div>
<h2 id="c13"><span class="small">CHAPTER XIII</span>
<br /><i>A Prisoner in the Dark</i></h2>
<p>While Mary Louise waited for her chocolate to
be served, she took the copy of the letter from
her handbag and read it again. The woman said
she was going to Florida. Oh, suppose her father
should be too late to catch her!</p>
<p>&ldquo;But if Mrs. Ferguson really is a crook, why
should she write all her plans to a prisoner, when
she would know that the letter would be censored?&rdquo;
Mary Louise asked herself.</p>
<p>Her eyes narrowed. The woman had written
the letter on purpose to deceive them! She probably
had no intention of going to Florida! Perhaps
it was a code letter.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_179">[179]</div>
<p>Mary Louise recalled the Lindbergh case, in
which the kidnaper had written a letter to a
prisoner in which the second word of every
sentence was a key, thus forming a message. She
decided to try to discover something like that
for herself. She read the letter again:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><i>Dear Girls:</i></p>
<p><i>You poor girls! Meet your misfortune with
this $500. U.S. justice is terrible! In what other
country would they detain innocent girls?</i></p>
<p><i>Baltimore is where I am now, but I am leaving
immediately for a trip to Florida. Margaret
can&rsquo;t go with me on account of school. Will you
write to her? Get her address from the phone
book.</i></p>
<p><i>Treasure Island is playing at the movies, and
we liked it a lot. From my observation it is like
the book. C. S. enjoyed it thoroughly. And so did
I. Bring me back the book if you go home for
Christmas. It was mine anyhow.</i></p>
<p><i>Tonight I am packing. Baltimore is tiresome,
and I&rsquo;ll be glad to leave.</i></p>
<p><span class="jr"><i>Love,</i></span>
<span class="jr"><i>Aunt Ethel.</i></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>On a page of her notebook Mary Louise wrote
down each second word and read the result to
herself:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor&mdash;your&mdash;courts&mdash;what&mdash;is&mdash;can&rsquo;t&mdash;her&mdash;island&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_180">[180]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Shucks! That doesn&rsquo;t mean a thing!&rdquo; she
muttered in disgust. &ldquo;I guess I was crazy. But
just the same, it does seem like a dumb sort of
letter if it hasn&rsquo;t some underlying meaning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The waitress brought her chocolate in a lovely
little blue pot, and the whipped cream in a bowl.
On a plate of the same set, dainty pink and white
cakes were piled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a good thing I&rsquo;m not dieting,&rdquo; thought
Mary Louise, as she poured out a steaming cup
of chocolate. &ldquo;This certainly looks delicious!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She wondered idly, as she finished her refreshments,
whether she should go to a picture show,
just to put in her time. She wasn&rsquo;t exactly in the
mood for that kind of entertainment; her own
life was too exciting at the present moment to
allow her to feel the need for fiction. So, while
she waited for her bill, she glanced again at the
letter in her handbag.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I might try the first word of each sentence,&rdquo;
she thought. &ldquo;To see whether I could form a
message that way. Though I should think that
would be too obvious.... Still, I&rsquo;ll see what
happens.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She jotted down the opening word of each sentence
on another page of her notebook.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&mdash;meet&mdash;us&mdash;in&mdash;Baltimore&mdash;&#8203;Margaret&mdash;&#8203;will&mdash;&#8203;get&mdash;&#8203;treasure&mdash;&#8203;from&mdash;&#8203;C.S.&mdash;&#8203;and&mdash;&#8203;bring&mdash;&#8203;it&mdash;&#8203;to&mdash;&#8203;Baltimore.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_181">[181]</div>
<p>It was all Mary Louise could do to keep from
crying out in her joy. Of course that was the answer!
Pauline and Mary were to go to Baltimore.
The treasure, the stolen goods, must be in
that house at C.S.&mdash;Center Square. And &ldquo;Margaret&rdquo;
would go there to get it!</p>
<p>Mary Louise no longer had any difficulty in
deciding what to do with her afternoon. She&rsquo;d
drive to Center Square as fast as she could&mdash;in
order to beat &ldquo;Margaret&rdquo; there. Oh, how she
hoped that the &ldquo;Margaret&rdquo; referred to was Margaret
Detweiler!</p>
<p>Her hands actually trembled as she paid the
bill, she was in such haste to be off. She hadn&rsquo;t
time to go back to the hotel and inform Mrs.
Hilliard of her plan. Later on she was to wish
desperately that she had taken that precaution.</p>
<p>Instead, she hurried to the agency and hired
the same car she had driven the previous day.
Then she set off on the road which was by this
time becoming familiar.</p>
<p>It was after five o&rsquo;clock when Mary Louise
reached Center Square. The twilight was deepening;
already the short winter day was almost
at a close.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll need a flashlight,&rdquo; she decided and she
stopped in at a country store to buy one.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_182">[182]</div>
<p>When she came out of the store she drove directly
to the abandoned house. This time she did
not want to take the constable with her, for he
would forbid her breaking into the place. Yet
that was exactly what Mary Louise meant to do,
if she could not be admitted by knocking at the
door!</p>
<p>She turned into the driveway, past the &ldquo;No
Trespassing&rdquo; sign, mounted the steep incline,
and parked her car in an inconspicuous spot behind
the house and at the side of the barn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s hoping I don&rsquo;t get hit with a rock!&rdquo;
she thought recklessly, as she jumped out of the
car. The darkness was becoming deeper; the
silence was broken only by the moaning of the
tree branches in the wind. The place seemed
completely deserted.</p>
<p>With her heart beating fast, Mary Louise ran
to the back door of the house and tried it. As she
had anticipated, it was securely locked. A moment
later she encountered the same condition
at the front door. At both entrances she knocked
loudly; at neither was there any response.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just the same, I&rsquo;m going to get in!&rdquo; she muttered
resolutely. &ldquo;If I have to climb over the
porch to a second-story window!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_183">[183]</div>
<p>She walked around the house again, more
slowly this time, examining each window as she
passed it. Everywhere she found boards nailed
over the glass. On only one window at the side
did she discover a partial opening. It was the
window through which she had seen the face of
the young girl with the ugly woman beside her.</p>
<p>Mary Louise&rsquo;s heart leaped up in joy. She
could break through that glass and get in!</p>
<p>The window which she was examining was at
least three feet from the ground, and two boards
were nailed across the lower sash. But by standing
on a log which she dragged to the spot she
was able to reach the upper sash. With the aid of
a stone she smashed the glass into bits.</p>
<p>It would have been easier to climb through
the opening without her fur coat, but Mary
Louise felt sure that she would need its protection
in the damp, cold house. How thankful she
was later on that she had not yielded to her first
impulse!</p>
<p>She accomplished the feat successfully, however,
without even tearing her clothing or breaking
her flashlight, and stood on the floor of a
room which she soon identified as the dining
room.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_184">[184]</div>
<p>It was horribly cold and damp inside the
house, but Mary Louise scarcely noticed it at
first. A thrill of excitement sent a pleasant glow
through her body. She was going to search for
the treasure!</p>
<p>Keeping her flashlight turned on, she gave a
quick glance about the room. A table, half a
dozen chairs, a sideboard of beautiful mahogany,
and a china-closet filled with lovely dishes
comprised its furnishings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A good place to begin my search!&rdquo; she decided,
going straight to the attractive sideboard
and opening the drawer nearest the top. A luncheon
set of exquisite design greeted her eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rather grand for a country place,&rdquo; she silently
commented. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s see what else we can
find!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A second drawer was entirely empty, but a
third contained a full set of silverware. Seizing
a spoon in one hand, Mary Louise turned the
flashlight on it with the other. A wild cry of joy
escaped her lips; the spoon was decorated with
an ivy-leaf pattern! Yes, and there were the initials,
too&mdash;S.H. (for Stoddard House, Mrs. Hilliard
had said)&mdash;engraved on the stem!</p>
<p>&ldquo;So I know that I&rsquo;m in the right place!&rdquo; she
couldn&rsquo;t help exclaiming aloud in her triumph.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_185">[185]</div>
<p>The sound of her own voice in the silent, dark
house was strange; Mary Louise found herself
trembling. But only for a moment: courage and
common sense came to her rescue. Hastily she
gathered all the silver together and put it in a
pile on the dining-room table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I may have to go out through the window
again,&rdquo; she figured, &ldquo;so I&rsquo;ll leave my stuff here.
But first I&rsquo;ll try the doors from the inside.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There, however, she met disappointment.
There were no dead latches on the doors; they
were both locked securely, and the keys had been
removed.</p>
<p>Now that she had familiarized herself with
the plan of the house, she decided to make a systematic
search, beginning with the upstairs and
working her way down. Cautiously she ascended
the wide stairway in the hall to the second floor.</p>
<p>There were four bedrooms, she saw by the aid
of her flashlight, and a bathroom. A narrow
staircase led to an attic above.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I might as well begin with the attic,&rdquo; she
thought, &ldquo;and do the thing thoroughly. That
would be a natural place to hide things&mdash;especially
if there&rsquo;s a closet.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_186">[186]</div>
<p>There was a huge closet, she soon discovered,
besides two trunks, and all sorts of odds and ends
of furniture piled about the room. Naturally,
Mary Louise began her search with the trunks:
to her delight she found them unlocked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I only have the same luck that I had in
the dining room!&rdquo; she wished as she began to examine
the trays.</p>
<p>Things had apparently been stuffed in hit-or-miss
fashion: ribbons, scarves, odd bits of costumes
were all entangled together. Off in a corner
of the tray she found a heavy box which
looked especially inviting. Opening it excitedly
she let out a wild whoop of joy. There was jewelry
inside!</p>
<p>But when she examined the articles one by one
she experienced only disappointment. There was
nothing valuable in the whole collection; it was
merely &ldquo;five-and-ten-store&rdquo; stuff, which nobody
would wear except to a costume party.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I might have expected that,&rdquo; she mused as
she put the box back into the tray. &ldquo;If this trunk
had had anything valuable in it, it would have
been locked.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nevertheless, she resolved to make her search
thorough and went through both trunks, without
any success. Then she directed her attention to
the closet.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_187">[187]</div>
<p>This occupied a large space&mdash;almost as big as
a small room&mdash;so that Mary Louise found that
she could easily enter it herself. It was horribly
chilly and damp; she shivered, and drew her
coat more tightly around her as she continued
her task.</p>
<p>She was peering into a hat box when she suddenly
heard a pounding on a wall. She stopped
what she was doing and listened intently. Where
was the noise coming from? Had someone come
in? Was &ldquo;Margaret&rdquo; here, or had the police
come to arrest Mary Louise for housebreaking?
Her hands shook and she turned off her flashlight,
waiting tensely in the darkness, while the
pounding continued. But she did not hear any
footsteps.</p>
<p>The noise finally ceased, and, reassured at
last, Mary Louise turned on her flashlight and
resumed her search. But the attic revealed nothing
of any importance, not even any loose boards
in the walls or floor underneath which the treasure
might have been stored.</p>
<p>With a sigh of disappointment, Mary Louise
descended the attic steps.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_188">[188]</div>
<p>Entering the bedrooms one after the other and
searching them carefully, she encountered no
better results. The bureaus were practically
empty; the beds contained only a blanket spread
over each mattress, and though Mary Louise felt
around them with her hands for hard objects
which might be concealed, she found nothing.</p>
<p>Looking at her watch, she saw to her surprise
that it was almost eight o&rsquo;clock. Supper hour
was long past; because of her excitement, and on
account of her refreshments in the Philadelphia
tea shop, she had not felt hungry. But she was
thirsty and was delighted to find running water
in the bathroom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad I don&rsquo;t have to climb out of that
window to get a drink at the pump!&rdquo; she congratulated
herself. And while she was there she
methodically searched the bathroom, again without
any success.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, here&rsquo;s an electric light button!&rdquo; she exclaimed
in surprise. &ldquo;These people must be rich&mdash;they
have all the modern improvements. And
I&rsquo;ve been using up my battery!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the light did not turn on; no doubt the
current was cut off while the people were away,
and Mary Louise had to resort to her flashlight
again.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_189">[189]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Because I started in the attic, the treasure
will probably be in the cellar,&rdquo; she concluded.
&ldquo;I hope my battery doesn&rsquo;t give out before I get
to it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nevertheless, she meant to proceed with the
downstairs first, just as she had planned. She
would rather be there if &ldquo;Margaret&rdquo; arrived.
Oh, how she wished the girl would come! Especially
if she proved to be Margaret Detweiler.</p>
<p>The kitchen consumed a great deal of time,
for she had to look in every possible can and dish
in the various closets. As she examined everything,
she was conscious of increasing hunger;
she sincerely hoped that she would find something
she could eat. But her search revealed
nothing except some dry groceries: tea, sugar,
salt, and spices. Moreover, the stove was an electric
one, useless without current. She could not
even heat water to make herself a cup of tea!</p>
<p>She was debating whether she should crawl
out of the window and go to a store for something
to eat, or whether she should wait until
she had completed her task. It was just nine
o&rsquo;clock now; if she left the house she might miss
seeing Margaret and lose all chance of finding
either the girl or the treasure. But as she passed
through the dining room from the kitchen she
saw immediately that her decision had been
made for her. The window through which she
had crawled into the house had been boarded up
tightly! She was a helpless prisoner in this dark,
lonely house!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_190">[190]</div>
<p>So that was the explanation of the pounding
which she had heard from the attic closet! Oh,
why hadn&rsquo;t she rushed down to see who was doing
it? Now what in the world could she do? If
Margaret didn&rsquo;t come, she would have to spend
the night here&mdash;alone! And tomorrow was
Christmas!</p>
<p>But suppose nobody came tomorrow&mdash;or the
next day&mdash;or the next week! Starvation, death
from pneumonia, loneliness that would drive her
insane&mdash;all these grim horrors stared Mary
Louise in the face.</p>
<p>Shivering with cold, she stood motionless in
the dining room and tried to think of some way
out. It would be impossible for her to break
down those heavy wooden doors, and she knew
nothing about picking locks. There wasn&rsquo;t an
unboarded window on the whole first floor, and
even the windows over the porch on the second
floor were tightly nailed shut. Oh, what on earth
could she do?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_191">[191]</div>
<p>&ldquo;If only Max and Norman would come along
now and give that familiar signal!&rdquo; she wished.
But no sound disturbed the silence of the night;
even the wind had died, leaving a stillness like
death all about her. She felt buried alive in a
doorless tomb.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nobody knows I&rsquo;m here,&rdquo; she moaned. &ldquo;Not
even Mrs. Hilliard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have to think of something,&rdquo; she decided,
with a supreme effort to keep herself in control.
&ldquo;In the meanwhile, I might as well finish my
search.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But even that satisfaction was denied to Mary
Louise. In the doorway between the dining room
and the living room her flashlight went out. At
the most critical moment, when her courage was
at the lowest ebb, the battery had died!</p>
<p>A groan of agonized dismay escaped from her
lips. In utter despair she groped for a chair and
sank down in it, miserable and defeated.</p>
<p>The impenetrable blackness of the room was
overpowering, for she was used to the lights of
the streets in Philadelphia and in Riverside. A
strange, physical fear took possession of her,
paralyzing her limbs; for several minutes she
sat still in the darkness, not even attempting to
move.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_192">[192]</div>
<p>A shiver ran through her; she was becoming
colder and colder in this damp, icy house. Her
need for warmth stirred her to action. She rose
cautiously to her feet and groped her way to the
hall, where she remembered the stairway to be
located, and without encountering any serious
knocks, she slowly ascended to one of the bedrooms.</p>
<p>Here the inky blackness still confronted her,
but it was not so deep as that of the first floor, for
there was an unboarded window in the room.
Gradually, as she made her way towards it,
Mary Louise could perceive its outline. Most
of the window was covered by the tree branches,
but here and there through the limbs she could
distinguish patches of sky. Yes&mdash;far off, and
dim, but real, nevertheless&mdash;was one shining
star!</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Christmas star,&rdquo; she murmured. &ldquo;Or at
least&mdash;my Christmas star. For it&rsquo;s the only one
I&rsquo;ll see tonight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was something immensely comforting
in its presence. The star reassured her, it reminded
her that God was still in His heaven,
and she was not forsaken. Tomorrow, Christmas
morning, rescue would surely come!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_193">[193]</div>
<p>So, after collecting all the blankets in the
house on one bed, she took off her coat and her
hat and her shoes and lay down, drawing the
squirrel coat over her on top of the blankets.
Cold and hunger and her dark prison were forgotten
in a blissful maze of unconsciousness.
Mary Louise slept until the sun of the strangest
Christmas of her experience awakened her.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_194">[194]</div>
<h2 id="c14"><span class="small">CHAPTER XIV</span>
<br /><i>The Secret Band</i></h2>
<p>Mr. Gay settled back in his seat in the train with
a sense of comfort. He liked traveling; no matter
how hard he was working or how difficult
the case he was trying to solve, he could always
rest on a journey.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I might have brought Mary Lou with me,&rdquo;
he thought. &ldquo;She would have liked the experience.&rdquo;
But perhaps, he decided, she had wanted
to remain on the spot at Stoddard House in case
anything new developed. Little did he think as
he was speeding along towards Baltimore that
his daughter was driving as fast as she could in
the opposite direction. Into a new danger which
he had not dreamed of!</p>
<p>Mary Louise, in her systematic way, had given
her father a list of all the valuables to be recovered.
Now, at his leisure, he took the paper from
his pocket and went over it carefully.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_195">[195]</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Set of silverware, ivy-leaf pattern, initials S.H.</p>
<p class="t0">Chinese vase.</p>
<p class="t0">5 watches, including one set with diamonds and my own.</p>
<p class="t0">$550 in cash.</p>
<p class="t0">Painting by Whistler.</p>
<p class="t0">Pair of diamond earrings.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>Mr. Gay let out a low whistle. What a list that
was! No wonder Mrs. Hilliard was worried!</p>
<p>He took from his pocket the other slip of paper,
which the detective at the Ritz had just
given to him.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Gold-mesh handbag containing $200.</p>
<p class="t0">2 pearl rings....&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;If this woman, this Mrs. Ferguson, is responsible
for all this, she certainly ought to be kept
behind prison bars for the rest of her life,&rdquo; he
thought. &ldquo;But we&rsquo;ll see&mdash;we&rsquo;ll see....&rdquo;</p>
<p>His train passed through a small town, and
from his window Mr. Gay could see the Christmas
decorations in the houses. How he wished
that he and Mary Louise could both be at home,
taking part in the happy celebrations! Trimming
the tree, filling the stockings, eating the
turkey dinner together! But there would be
more Christmases, he reminded himself, and the
whole family would be together on New Year&rsquo;s
Day.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_196">[196]</div>
<p>It was dusk when he arrived in Baltimore and
he took a taxi straight to the Hotel Phillips. He
engaged a room for he meant to take a shower
and have his dinner there, even if he did not remain
all night.</p>
<p>A few minutes later he was interviewing the
hotel detective in his private office.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is there a Mrs. Ferguson staying here?&rdquo; he
asked, after he had shown his badge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, there is,&rdquo; replied the other man. &ldquo;She
came two days ago with two daughters and four
other girls as guests. They have a suite of rooms
on the ninth floor and are planning to stay over
Christmas.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Has anything been stolen since their arrival?&rdquo;
questioned Mr. Gay.</p>
<p>The other detective&rsquo;s eyes opened wide in surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. A roll of bills, two hundred dollars, I
believe it amounted to, and a valuable stamp
collection. Last night. But surely&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_197">[197]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I have reasons to suspect Mrs. Ferguson and
her accomplices,&rdquo; stated Mr. Gay. &ldquo;Other hotel
robberies lead us to believe she is the leader of
a band of hotel thieves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But we are on the track of another suspect.
A man we found wandering into the wrong room
last night and excusing himself by the old gag
of saying he was drunk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe he was drunk!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Possibly. We couldn&rsquo;t get any sense out of
him. But I believe that he was just a darned good
actor. Another fellow got away&mdash;an accomplice,
I think, who is known to be a stamp collector.
We&rsquo;re on his trail.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to search the Ferguson woman&rsquo;s
rooms,&rdquo; announced Mr. Gay. &ldquo;Can I have your
help?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man hesitated. He hated to antagonize
wealthy guests who were bringing so much
money into the hotel; yet when he recalled the
expression of Mrs. Ferguson&rsquo;s eyes he remembered
that he had distrusted her. So he reluctantly
consented to the other detective&rsquo;s request.</p>
<p>Taking one of his assistants with him, the
hotel detective led Mr. Gay to the ninth floor
and knocked at Mrs. Ferguson&rsquo;s door. From
within sounds of laughter and gay music could
be heard. As the door opened, the three men saw
the girls playing cards in the sitting room of the
luxurious suite. A radio was grinding out jazz.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_198">[198]</div>
<p>With a shrewd glance at the girls, Mr. Gay
realized immediately that they were not the same
type as his daughter&rsquo;s friends at Riverside. They
were older, too, although they were painted and
lipsticked to appear young.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Ferguson,&rdquo; began the hotel detective,
&ldquo;I must apologize for interrupting your card
game, but I have to go through with a routine.
Last night some valuables were stolen from one
of our guests, and I have promised him to make
a thorough search of each room. You understand,
of course, that no slight is meant to you
or to your guests. The girls can go on with their
game, if you will just permit us to look around.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Ferguson, who was, Mr. Gay thought,
one of the ugliest women he had ever seen, drew
herself up proudly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I very much resent it,&rdquo; she replied haughtily.
&ldquo;In fact I forbid it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t do that,&rdquo; answered the detective
coolly. &ldquo;For even if you decide to leave the
hotel, your things will be searched before you
go. But please don&rsquo;t be unreasonable, Mrs. Ferguson!
Suppose that you, for instance, had been
robbed of that beautiful diamond ring you are
wearing. Wouldn&rsquo;t you want us to do everything
in our power to get it back for you?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_199">[199]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t want guests&mdash;especially women
and girls&mdash;subjected to such insults as you were
offering me and my young friends and relatives!
Besides, I thought you were already pretty sure
of your thief.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re not sure of anything. Will you submit
peacefully, Mrs. Ferguson, or must we call in
the police?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The woman looked sullen and did not answer;
the detective stepped across the room and locked
the door. Mrs. Ferguson turned her back and
wandered indifferently towards the bare Christmas
tree in the corner. It was standing upright
in a box of green, but it had not been trimmed.
A pile of boxes beside it indicated the ornaments
with which it would probably soon be decorated.</p>
<p>Mr. Gay, always the keenest observer, sensed
that fact that Mrs. Ferguson had some special
interest in those boxes, and his first shrewd surmise
was that valuables were somehow concealed
within them. Therefore, he kept his eye glued
on that corner of the room.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_200">[200]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I guess you&rsquo;ll have to stop your games, girls,&rdquo;
said Mrs. Ferguson, &ldquo;since these men mean to
be objectionable. Of course, we&rsquo;ll move to another
hotel immediately, so you can all go and
get your things packed.... Pauline, you take
care of these balls for the tree. Men like this
wouldn&rsquo;t care whether they were smashed or
not! They have no Christmas spirit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some hotel!&rdquo; muttered Pauline, with an oath
under her breath. But she got up and went
towards the Christmas tree.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait a minute!&rdquo; ordered Mr. Gay. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
looking into those boxes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Ferguson laughed scornfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They just came from the &lsquo;Five and Ten,&rsquo;&rdquo;
she said. &ldquo;They haven&rsquo;t even been unwrapped.
And I warn you men, if you break them, you
can replace them! It&rsquo;s not easy to get through the
crowds now, either.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Detective Gay smiled. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take the responsibility,&rdquo;
he promised as he untied the string of
the top package. As Mrs. Ferguson had stated,
it contained nothing but bright new Christmas-tree
balls.</p>
<p>But when he lifted the second box in the pile&mdash;a
huge package as big as a hat box&mdash;he knew
immediately that it was too heavy to contain
Christmas-tree ornaments. Nevertheless, his
countenance was expressionless as he untied the
string.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_201">[201]</div>
<p>A great quantity of tissue paper covered the
top of the box; this Mr. Gay removed, and from
beneath it he drew forth a shabby blue book.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is this the stamp album?&rdquo; he asked the hotel
detective.</p>
<p>The other man gasped and rushed to Mr.
Gay&rsquo;s side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes! Yes!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s it! See if the
stamps are still in it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With a quick movement Pauline Brooks took
two steps forward and snatched the book from
the detective&rsquo;s hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s my album!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;If you
don&rsquo;t believe it, look at the name in the front.&rdquo;
Triumphantly she turned to the first page and
displayed the inscription:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0"><i>Pauline Brooks,</i></p>
<p class="t3"><i>Christmas, 1931.</i></p>
<p class="t6"><i>From Aunt Ethel.</i></p>
</div>
<p>Detective Gay laughed scornfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t fool us that easily, Miss Brooks,&rdquo;
he said. &ldquo;Examine the ink in the handwriting
for yourself! It&rsquo;s fresh.... You can&rsquo;t pass that
off for three years old.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pauline looked calmly into her accuser&rsquo;s eyes.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_202">[202]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe it is,&rdquo; she retorted. &ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t have
to write my name in my books the minute I get
them, do I?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hand it over!&rdquo; commanded the hotel detective,
while Mr. Gay continued his search of the
Christmas boxes. At the bottom of the pile he
found the gold-mesh handbag with two pearl
rings inside it. But he did not discover any of the
lost money.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Call the police,&rdquo; ordered the hotel detective,
turning to his assistant. &ldquo;Gay and I will make a
thorough search of this room. And on your way
downstairs get hold of Mr. Jones, in room 710.
He can come up here and identify his stamp album.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Ferguson by this time had slipped into
her bedroom, and one by one the girls were following
her. Detective Gay, suddenly aware of
the fact that the criminals meant to escape by another
door, dashed out into the hall just in time
to stop them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Must we use handcuffs?&rdquo; he demanded,
pushing Mrs. Ferguson back into her room and
locking the door.</p>
<p>The woman did not reply, but she looked at
him with an expression of hatred in her eyes.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_203">[203]</div>
<p>Mr. Gay called into the next room to the hotel
detective, who was still making a systematic
search. &ldquo;Can you get me a photographer?&rdquo; he
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O.K.,&rdquo; was the reply, and the detective put
the message through, using the room telephone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, what do you want a photographer
for?&rdquo; demanded Pauline impudently. &ldquo;Because
we&rsquo;re such pretty girls?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to send your picture to my daughter,&rdquo;
replied Mr. Gay. &ldquo;I understand that you and
she used to be friends.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is your daughter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mary Louise Gay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The little rat! If I&rsquo;d ever realized&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How smart she is,&rdquo; supplied Mr. Gay
proudly, &ldquo;you&rsquo;d have been more careful! Well,
Miss Brooks, you&rsquo;ve been pretty clever, but not
quite clever enough. This is the end of your
dangerous career.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess we can get out on bail!&rdquo; she boasted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess you can&rsquo;t! Not this time, young lady!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The photographer and the police arrived at
the same time; Mrs. Ferguson and her band of
six had to submit to having their pictures taken
and were allowed, under supervision, to pack a
few necessary articles of clothing into their suitcases.
Then, under the escort of four policemen
and the assistant hotel detective, they rode downstairs
to the waiting patrol car.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_204">[204]</div>
<p>Mr. Gay and the hotel detective went on with
their methodical search.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Suppose we stop and eat,&rdquo; suggested the latter.
&ldquo;We can lock up these rooms.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O.K.,&rdquo; agreed Mr. Gay.</p>
<p>A knock sounded at the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m Jones&mdash;the man who lost the album,&rdquo;
announced the visitor. &ldquo;Did you fellows really
get it?&rdquo; His question held all the eagerness of
the collector.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This it?&rdquo; queried the hotel detective, holding
the worn blue book up to view.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, boy! Is it? I&rsquo;ll say so! Let&rsquo;s see it!&rdquo; He
grasped the book affectionately.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are still hoping to find your money, too,&rdquo;
added Mr. Gay. But the man was hardly listening;
his stamps meant far more to him than his
roll of bills.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whom do I thank for this?&rdquo; he inquired
finally, as he opened the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My daughter,&rdquo; returned Mr. Gay. &ldquo;But she
isn&rsquo;t here, and I&rsquo;ll have to tell you the story some
other time.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_205">[205]</div>
<p>During their supper together, Mr. Gay told
the hotel detective about Mary Louise and the
discoveries she had made which led her to suspect
Mrs. Ferguson and Pauline Brooks. He
brought the list out of his pocket and crossed off
the articles that had been recovered: the gold-mesh
bag and the two pearl rings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Except for the money which was stolen here
last night, we probably shan&rsquo;t find anything else
in the rooms,&rdquo; he concluded. &ldquo;Mrs. Ferguson
has no doubt hidden or disposed of everything
which her gang stole from Stoddard House.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the two men resumed their
search after dinner. Deeply hidden in the artificial
grass which filled the Christmas-tree box,
they found four hundred dollars&mdash;the exact
amount which had been taken from the Hotel
Ritz in Philadelphia and the Hotel Phillips
there in Baltimore. But two hours&rsquo; more searching
revealed nothing else. At ten o&rsquo;clock the two
men decided to quit.</p>
<p>Mr. Gay went directly to his room and called
Stoddard House on the telephone, asking to
speak to Mary Louise.</p>
<p>To his surprise it was Mrs. Hilliard who answered
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mary Louise did not come home for supper,&rdquo;
she said. &ldquo;I concluded that she had gone to
Baltimore with you, Mr. Gay.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_206">[206]</div>
<p>&ldquo;No, she didn&rsquo;t. Could she have gone to the
movies with any of the girls, do you think?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Possibly. But she usually tells me where she
is going. Of course she may have gone home
with the Walder girls, and I know their folks
haven&rsquo;t a phone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Gay seemed reassured; after all, he decided,
nothing could happen to his daughter
now that the criminals were under lock and key.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, tell her I&rsquo;ll take the first train home tomorrow,&rdquo;
he concluded, &ldquo;and that I have good
news for her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will, Mr. Gay,&rdquo; promised the hotel manager.</p>
<p>Disappointed but not worried, he replaced
the receiver and went down to the desk to inquire
for the picture of Mrs. Ferguson&rsquo;s band of
thieves. Several copies had been struck off, and
they were surprisingly good. Mr. Gay chuckled
when he thought how pleased Mary Louise
would be to see all the criminals lined up together.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_207">[207]</div>
<p>Taking the pictures with him, he went
straight to the offices of Baltimore&rsquo;s leading
newspapers. In a short time he had given the
editors the important facts of the capture of the
dangerous band, giving the credit to Mary
Louise. To one of these newspapers he gave his
daughter&rsquo;s picture&mdash;a snapshot which he always
carried in his pocket.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait till Riverside sees that!&rdquo; he exulted.
&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t our family be proud of our Mary Lou!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Gay slept soundly that night, believing
that everything was all right with Mary Louise.
Had he but known the agony of spirit his
daughter was experiencing he would have returned
posthaste to Philadelphia.</p>
<p>Mrs. Hilliard, however, was more concerned
and spent a restless night. She felt sure that
something had happened to Mary Louise, for
she was not the sort of girl to go off without
mentioning her plans. Even if she had gone to
the country with the Walder girls, she would
have found a way to telephone. Mary Louise
was never thoughtless or selfish.</p>
<p>In her worried condition, Mrs. Hilliard
awakened twice during the night and went down
and looked into the girl&rsquo;s empty room. At six
o&rsquo;clock she could stand the anxiety no longer,
and she called Mr. Gay on the long distance
telephone.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_208">[208]</div>
<p>He was in bed, asleep, but the first ring at his
bedside awakened him. He listened to Mrs. Hilliard&rsquo;s
news with a sinking heart, remembering
the dreadful thing which had happened to his
daughter the previous summer, while she was
investigating a mystery of crime.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take the seven o&rsquo;clock train to Philadelphia!&rdquo;
he cried, already snatching his clothing
from the chair beside his bed.</p>
<p>In his haste and his deep concern for his
daughter he forgot entirely that this was Christmas
morning. When the waiter in the dining car
greeted him with a respectful &ldquo;Merry Christmas,
sir,&rdquo; Mr. Gay stared at him blankly. Then
he remembered and made the correct reply.</p>
<p>One look at Mrs. Hilliard&rsquo;s face as he entered
Stoddard House told him that there was no news
of his girl. Mary Louise had not returned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The only place I can think of,&rdquo; said Mrs.
Hilliard, &ldquo;for I&rsquo;ve already gotten in touch with
the Walder girls, is that empty house out in
Center Square, where she was hit on the head
the night she went there with Max Miller.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_209">[209]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll drive right out there,&rdquo; announced Mr.
Gay immediately. &ldquo;I guess I can make inquiries
at the hotel.... And in the meantime I&rsquo;ll
notify the Philadelphia police, but I&rsquo;ll warn
them not to give out the news on the radio till
I get back.... I don&rsquo;t want to alarm Mary
Lou&rsquo;s mother until it is necessary.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ten minutes later he was in a taxicab, directing
the driver to speed as fast as the law allowed
to Center Square.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_210">[210]</div>
<h2 id="c15"><span class="small">CHAPTER XV</span>
<br /><i>Christmas Morning</i></h2>
<p>Christmas morning!</p>
<p>Mary Louise laughed out loud when she
wakened amid the bleakness of her surroundings
in that empty house near Center Square.
Oh, how different it was from every other
Christmas of her experience! No lovely fragrance
of evergreen, no warm fire, no cheery hot
breakfast&mdash;no presents! But this last fact worried
her least of all. At the moment she believed
she would give up all the Christmas presents
in the world for a plate of sausage and hot cakes.</p>
<p>She felt a little stiff from sleeping in her
clothing, but underneath the blankets and her
fur coat she had not suffered from the cold. And,
oh, how good it was to see the sun! To be able
to walk around in a light house&mdash;or a dimly
lighted one, for even some of the second-story
windows were boarded up.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_211">[211]</div>
<p>She shuddered at the fear that no one might
come that day to rescue her, that she might be
subjected to another black night in this dismal
place. But with daylight to aid her perhaps she
could find a way out for herself, if no one came.
She would try not to lose hope.</p>
<p>She got up and washed, thankful at least for
the water in the house, and she took a long
drink. Then she remembered that there was tea
in the kitchen, and even though there was no
way of heating the water, she could make cold
tea and add sugar. Perhaps the sugar would supply
a little energy.</p>
<p>With her fur coat buttoned up to her neck she
cautiously descended the stairway in the hall.
Downstairs it was so dark that she could not
even see the outlines of the furniture until her
eyes became accustomed to the dimness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There must be candles in the kitchen,&rdquo; she
surmised. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;m afraid it will be too dark to
find them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She groped her way out to the kitchen, and
fumbled around until she touched the dresser.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d never be able to tell which is sugar and
which is salt,&rdquo; she thought. &ldquo;Except that I can
taste anything I happen to find.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_212">[212]</div>
<p>However, that proceeding might not prove to
be so good, she decided, for she had no desire
to taste kitchen cleanser or rat poison, for instance.
No, it would be better to do without than
to take any risks, just for the sake of a cup of
cold tea!</p>
<p>As she cautiously ran her hand along the bottom
shelf of the dresser, her fingers encountered
something decidedly rough. For a moment she
was puzzled, until she could identify the object.
But in a moment she recognized it. Sandpaper,
of course! Sandpaper on the outside of a box of
matches.</p>
<p>Her pulse quickened as she picked up the box,
and found that it was full. This was luck indeed!
She struck a match at once, and began to
hunt feverishly for candles. But she wasted three
matches without finding a single one.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can have my cold tea, anyway,&rdquo; she
thought, and with the aid of a single match she
located tea and sugar and a cup. The sink was
right beside the dresser, and she ran cold water
over the tea leaves.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Merry Christmas, Mary Lou!&rdquo; she finally
said aloud, as she drank the cold tea through
closed teeth, to avoid swallowing the leaves.</p>
<p>She felt chillier than ever after she had finished
it, but not quite so weak and empty. Lighting
another match she made her way into the
living room.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_213">[213]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t it be wonderful if there were an
open fireplace all piled up with wood!&rdquo; she
mused, as she entered the room.</p>
<p>There was a fireplace, she found, but it was
totally empty. On a shelf over it, however, she
came upon a discovery which she had overlooked
the previous night. There, right in the
middle of the mantelpiece, stood a Chinese vase
of the very design which Mrs. Hilliard had described!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe if I look around I&rsquo;ll find Miss
Granger&rsquo;s painting,&rdquo; was her next hope.</p>
<p>She examined the picture over the fireplace&mdash;a
cheap hunting scene&mdash;and was just about to
turn away when she made another find which
brought a whoop of joy to her lips. In plain
view, at each end of the shelf, stood two tall, red
candles!</p>
<p>When Mary Louise had lighted one of these
she felt suddenly like a different girl. It was
amazing what a change one steady little gleam
of light could make. But she was frugal enough
to burn only one of them; if she had to spend
another night in this house she would not need
to be in complete darkness.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_214">[214]</div>
<p>There was an upright piano at the other side
of the room; Mary Louise stepped over and sat
down on the stool in front of it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll play a Christmas carol, just to celebrate!&rdquo;
she decided, and struck the opening
chords of &ldquo;O come all ye faithful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She stopped abruptly. &ldquo;What a terrible rattle!&rdquo;
she exclaimed. &ldquo;These people must throw
their tin cans into the piano when they finish
with them!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She stood up and examined the top with her
candle. Lifting up the hinged half, she peered
down into the space beneath. Instantly she perceived
a gray flannel bag hanging on the end of
one of the keys as if someone had deliberately
hidden it there.</p>
<p>She snatched it off excitedly, delighted to find
that it was heavy. No doubt it contained something
metallic, which had been the cause of the
jangling of the piano keys. With trembling fingers
she pulled open the string and dumped the
contents of the bag upon a chair.</p>
<p>Diamond rings, bracelets, earrings, watches,
and gold necklaces dropped out before her
astonished eyes. A fabulous treasure, such as one
reads about in fairy tales or sometimes dreams
of finding! Color came to Mary Louise&rsquo;s cheeks,
and her heart raced wildly as she examined the
articles one by one to make sure that they were
genuine.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_215">[215]</div>
<p>Mrs. Weinberger&rsquo;s old-fashioned timepiece
ornamented with diamonds was there&mdash;and
Mary Louise&rsquo;s own dainty little wrist watch,
engraved with her name in the back of it. Oh,
what a joy it was to have it again! She clasped
it affectionately about her wrist.</p>
<p>Leaving the jewelry on the chair, she peered
into the piano again to see what else she could
find. She was rewarded with another discovery.
Down in a corner, in a remote spot, she saw a
small package wrapped in brown paper. She
encountered some difficulty in prying it loose,
but at last she had it free. Stripped of its brown-paper
wrapping, she found that she held a fat
wad of bills in her hand!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Macgregor&rsquo;s money!&rdquo; she thought immediately.
&ldquo;And Miss Granger&rsquo;s&mdash;and my own
five dollars!&rdquo;</p>
<p>How wonderful it all was! To be able to return
the possessions to the rightful owners at
Stoddard House! To have proof enough now
to convict Mrs. Ferguson and her band of
thieves! To collect her salary from Mrs. Hilliard
and go home&mdash;in time for Max&rsquo;s senior
dance!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_216">[216]</div>
<p>If&mdash;only&mdash;she could get out of this house!</p>
<p>A feverish sense of impatience took possession
of Mary Louise. It was cruel, she stormed,
that in her hour of triumph she should be imprisoned
alone in a dark house. Wouldn&rsquo;t somebody
miss her and come to her rescue? Where
was her father? Why hadn&rsquo;t he driven out here
to Center Square when he returned to Stoddard
House last night&mdash;and had found her missing?</p>
<p>But suppose&mdash;awful thought&mdash;that he had not
returned! Suppose he had missed finding Mrs.
Ferguson and had been deceived by that letter
of hers into pursuing the woman to Florida!
Mrs. Hilliard would conclude that he had taken
her&mdash;Mary Louise&mdash;with him, when neither returned!</p>
<p>A trip to Florida, Mary Louise figured,
might consume almost a week. While she waited
alone in this dark, cold house, each day itself
an eternity of hunger and loneliness and suffering!</p>
<p>A hollow laugh escaped her lips as she
glanced at the money and the valuables heaped
on the chair beside her. They were as little use
to her now as Midas&rsquo;s gold. They would neither
feed her nor keep her warm.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_217">[217]</div>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no use hoping for release by somebody
else,&rdquo; she told herself. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have to work
out a way by myself. I&rsquo;ll have to be a modern
Count of Monte Cristo!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She stood up and gathered her treasure together
again into the bag and took the Chinese
vase from the mantelpiece. Another tour of the
room revealed the Whistler picture in a dark
corner. With the aid of her half-burnt candle,
she carried everything to the dining room and
placed it all in a pile beside the silverware.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll hide the money inside my dress and the
jewelry in my coat pocket. These other things
I&rsquo;ll drop into that wood-basket I saw in the
kitchen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When she had finally completed her packing
she sat down in the dining room to think.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe I&rsquo;ll try to get out the same way I
got in,&rdquo; she decided. &ldquo;Because the glass is already
broken in that window. All I&rsquo;ll have to do
will be to cut my way through the new boards
which that caretaker&mdash;or whoever he was&mdash;hammered
on last night.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_218">[218]</div>
<p>With this purpose in view, Mary Louise carried
her candle into the kitchen. The drawer in
the dresser revealed a poor selection of knives;
it might take days to cut through a board with
only these as tools. Nevertheless, she meant to
try. Anything was better than idleness.</p>
<p>Selecting what appeared to be the sharpest in
the collection, she returned to the window in the
dining room. But she realized immediately that
her scheme would not work. The boards were
too close together; it would be impossible to insert
a knife between them at any place.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess I&rsquo;ll have to smash that bedroom window
and jump out,&rdquo; she thought gloomily. &ldquo;It
would probably mean a broken neck, but that&rsquo;s
better than a slow, lingering death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She pulled the dresser drawer farther out,
looking idly for some other implement to facilitate
her escape. Suddenly her eyes lighted upon
a hammer. Not a very large hammer, but adequate
enough for the task. Why hadn&rsquo;t she
thought of that plan before? It would be lots
easier to hammer those boards loose than to try
to cut through them with a knife.</p>
<p>She picked it up out of the drawer and paused
abruptly. There was a slight sound in the front
of the house, like the click of a key in a lock.
Extinguishing her candle, she waited breathlessly
till she heard the front door open. Someone
stepped cautiously into the hall!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_219">[219]</div>
<p>Mary Louise&rsquo;s heart stood still in her excitement.
Who was the intruder? Was it the Margaret
whom Mrs. Ferguson had mentioned in
her letter, or was it the woman herself? Whoever
it was, was he or she armed with a revolver?</p>
<p>Much as Mary Louise longed to find Margaret
Detweiler, she dared not take a chance
now of coming face to face with an unknown
person in this dark house, since all the valuables
were in her possession. Her only desire at the
moment was for escape. Silently she moved
towards the door of the kitchen which led directly
into the hall.</p>
<p>She heard the newcomer go into the living
room, and as Mary Louise crept past the doorway
she saw the gleam of a flashlight. But the
person, whoever it was, was hidden from her
view, and Mary Louise did not wait to find out
who it was. She reached the front door in safety
and found the key still reposing in the lock.</p>
<p>A second later she removed the key and
slipped out of the door into the clear, cold sunshine.
She was free at last!</p>
<p>And with a chuckle of triumph she inserted
the key on the outside of the door and turned it,
imprisoning the intruder, just as she herself had
been imprisoned for the last sixteen hours!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_220">[220]</div>
<h2 id="c16"><span class="small">CHAPTER XVI</span>
<br /><i>Two Captures</i></h2>
<p>For one ecstatic moment Mary Louise stood
motionless on the front porch, breathing the
cold, delicious air of freedom. Then she ran
around the side of the house to the rear to look
for her car.</p>
<p>At first she thought it was gone, for she could
not see it, huddled up close to the barn. But a
few steps more revealed it to her view, and,
weak as she was, she darted forward eagerly.</p>
<p>She decided that she would drive directly to
the hotel and have some breakfast; afterwards
she would inquire her way to the constable&rsquo;s
house. He could take charge of the valuables in
her possession and go back with her to meet the
intruder. For Mary Louise had no intention of
returning to Philadelphia without first learning
that person&rsquo;s identity.</p>
<p>Besides, she had forgotten to bring out with
her the basket containing the vase and the picture
and the silverware. No use going back to
Stoddard House without the entire loot!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_221">[221]</div>
<p>She climbed into the car and put her foot on
the starter&mdash;without any success. She pulled out
the choke and tried again and again. Five minutes
passed. She made one final effort, in vain.
The car was frozen!</p>
<p>Despair seized her; she did not know what
she could do. In her weakened condition, cold
and hungry as she was, she did not believe herself
physically capable of walking to the hotel.
The distance must be at least a mile, although it
had seemed so short by automobile.</p>
<p>She got out of the car and silently walked
back to the front porch of the house, listening
for sounds from the prisoner locked within its
walls. But she heard nothing until she reached
the driveway. Then a young man stepped from
behind a tree and almost frightened her to
death.</p>
<p>He was a tough-looking fellow of about nineteen
or twenty, she judged, in slovenly corduroy
trousers, a dirty lumber jacket, and cap. He
eyed her suspiciously; Mary Louise forced herself
to meet his gaze, although she was trembling
so that she had to keep her hand on the
jewelry in her pocket to prevent its rattling.</p>
<p>The young man edged up nearer to her.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_222">[222]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You one of Mrs. Ferguson&rsquo;s girls?&rdquo; he demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I know her,&rdquo; replied Mary Louise.
&ldquo;I&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You been in the house now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; admitted Mary Louise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anything gone?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t think so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s lucky,&rdquo; remarked the young man. &ldquo;I
come around last night about six o&rsquo;clock, same
as I do every night, and I seen a window was
broke on the side of the house. But I didn&rsquo;t see
nobody prowlin&rsquo; around, so I just nailed a board
across it. I&rsquo;m still watchin&rsquo; fer that guy that
come in a car. You kin tell Mrs. Ferguson he
ain&rsquo;t come back yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What guy?&rdquo; inquired Mary Louise, feeling
more at ease now, since this young man evidently
regarded her as one of Mrs. Ferguson&rsquo;s
gang of girls.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That fellow that drove up here last Sunday
night,&rdquo; was the reply. &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t Mrs. Ferguson
tell you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t seen Mrs. Ferguson to talk to,&rdquo; she
stammered, hardly able to keep from laughing.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_223">[223]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, this guy meant trouble, I&rsquo;m a-thinkin&rsquo;.
He drove up here in a car with a dame alongside
of him. I hid in a tree when I heard the car
comin&rsquo;, and when it was under the tree I
dropped a rock on the dame&rsquo;s head. Knocked
her out, and the guy had to rush her off to a doctor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Suppose you had killed her!&rdquo; exclaimed
Mary Louise solemnly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t supposin&rsquo;. Besides, nobody knows I
done it except Mrs. Ferguson and you girls, and
if any of you dames tell on me, I&rsquo;ve got plenty
to tell on you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No doubt about that,&rdquo; agreed Mary Louise.
&ldquo;Well, I must be getting on. I&rsquo;m going to the
hotel for breakfast.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How about my money?&rdquo; demanded the
young man. &ldquo;Mrs. Ferguson wrote me you&rsquo;d be
along today and said you&rsquo;d pay me. She
promised me ten bucks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This announcement scared Mary Louise; she
didn&rsquo;t know whether she should pay the man or
not, in order to keep up the pretence that she
was a member of the secret band. If she refused,
mightn&rsquo;t he knock her down? Yet if she complied
with his demand and let him see the roll of
bills, what would prevent his stealing them all
at once?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_224">[224]</div>
<p>However, a solution came to her mind, and
she decided to risk it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t more than five dollars in my
purse,&rdquo; she said, opening it and showing him the
contents. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have to pay you when I get back,
after I have something to eat. I&rsquo;m starved&mdash;I
didn&rsquo;t have any supper last night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O.K.,&rdquo; agreed the young man, to Mary
Louise&rsquo;s surprise. &ldquo;Meet me here in an hour?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, just about,&rdquo; returned Mary Louise,
hurrying down the driveway.</p>
<p>The minute she reached the road, out of sight
of the house, Mary Louise started to run, and
she kept on running for perhaps a couple of
minutes. Then she stopped abruptly, dropping
down on the cold, hard ground. She was so faint,
she did not believe that she could take another
step.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I must get there!&rdquo; she panted. &ldquo;I must&mdash;must&mdash;must&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the main highway was not even in sight:
only the long, desolate country road before her,
without a sign of a person or a house.</p>
<p>She staggered somehow to her feet and took
two or three steps forward. Utterly exhausted,
she sank again to the ground.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_225">[225]</div>
<p>&ldquo;A lot of good all my discoveries will do me
or the people of Stoddard House,&rdquo; she mused
bitterly, &ldquo;if I pass out here on the road!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She made another effort to rise, but she was
growing colder and weaker every minute. In
utter dismay she buried her head in her arms.</p>
<p>A sense of numbness began to creep over her
as she sat there; she was losing consciousness of
where she was when the sharp sound of a motor
horn aroused her to her senses.</p>
<p>A car stopped opposite her; for one tense second
she was afraid to look up for fear the occupants
were some of Mrs. Ferguson&rsquo;s gang. When
a pleasant masculine voice addressed her, she
felt the tears rush to her eyes in relief.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is the trouble, my girl?&rdquo; inquired the
man. &ldquo;Can I help you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Reassurance and an overwhelming sense of
gratitude almost prevented Mary Louise from
answering. The man with the kind voice was
someone she could trust: she saw by his manner
of dressing that he was a Catholic priest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes!&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;Can you take me to
the constable? Do you know where he lives?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, of course I can.&rdquo; It was an odd request,
but the good man asked no questions. He merely
got out of his car and lifted Mary Louise in beside
him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_226">[226]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d tell you the story&mdash;only I&rsquo;m so cold and
hungry,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Maybe&mdash;later&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right, my child,&rdquo; he replied soothingly.</p>
<p>In less than five minutes he stopped his car in
front of a plain brick house and helped Mary
Louise to the doorway.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Merry Christmas, Hodge!&rdquo; he said, when
the door was opened to his knock. &ldquo;This young
lady&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Merry Christmas, Father,&rdquo; returned the constable,
gazing at Mary Louise. Almost instantly
he recalled who she was. &ldquo;Come in, Miss Gay,&rdquo;
he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, how can I ever thank you enough?&rdquo; said
Mary Louise, fervently to the priest. But the
good man only smiled and departed as quickly
as he had appeared.</p>
<p>The smell of coffee, of breakfast&mdash;for it was
only a little after nine o&rsquo;clock&mdash;was overpowering
to the hungry, exhausted girl. She sank into
a chair with only one cry on her lips: &ldquo;Coffee!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before the constable could even ask her a
question, his wife hurried from the dining room
with a steaming cup in her hands. She was a
motherly woman of about forty-five; three children
immediately followed her into the living
room to see who the stranger was who had arrived
so mysteriously.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_227">[227]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Drink this, dear,&rdquo; said Mrs. Hodge, holding
the cup to Mary Louise&rsquo;s lips. &ldquo;I put cream and
sugar in it, so it won&rsquo;t burn you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nothing in her life had ever tasted half so
good to the cold, hungry girl as that fragrant
cup of coffee. She finished it to the last drop,
and a smile broke over her face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was that good!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;Oh, how
much better I feel!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must have some breakfast now,&rdquo; urged
Mrs. Hodge. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t crowd around Miss Gay so
closely, children! She needs room to breathe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m all right now&mdash;really,&rdquo; said Mary
Louise. The warmth of the room was working
its magic spell; for the first time now she noticed
the Christmas tree and the toys around the floor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been locked up alone in that empty
house of Mrs. Ferguson&rsquo;s since five o&rsquo;clock last
night&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; she began. But Mrs. Hodge refused
to let her talk until she had eaten her breakfast.</p>
<p>Mary Louise ate everything that was on the
table: a steaming bowl of oatmeal, an orange,
half a dozen hot-cakes, two pieces of sausage, a
glass of milk, and another cup of coffee. When
she had finally finished she said that she believed
she had enjoyed that breakfast more than any
meal she had ever had.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_228">[228]</div>
<p>The whole family listened while she briefly
told her story. Beginning with the code letter
which had directed her to Center Square, she
explained how she had broken into the empty
house and how she had been imprisoned by a
man who was evidently in Mrs. Ferguson&rsquo;s
employ.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He admitted hitting me&mdash;only of course he
didn&rsquo;t know it was I&mdash;over the head last Sunday.
He thinks I&rsquo;m one of Mrs. Ferguson&rsquo;s
gang. So will you go back with me and arrest
him, Constable Hodge?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I sure will,&rdquo; agreed the man, and he told one
of his children to run across the yard to get a
neighbor to help him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I found the stolen goods,&rdquo; concluded Mary
Louise, reaching into her dress and producing
the roll of bills and taking the bag of jewelry
from her pocket. &ldquo;Will you take charge of it till
I can bring my father up to get it? He&rsquo;s a detective
too, you see.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_229">[229]</div>
<p>Everyone gasped in amazement at the heap of
valuables which Mary Louise displayed before
their eyes. The children rushed forward excitedly,
and the young detective saw no reason
why they should not examine them to their
hearts&rsquo; content. One of the boys even wanted to
count the money.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how did you get out of that house?&rdquo; demanded
the constable. &ldquo;Did that man open the
door for you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh no,&rdquo; replied Mary Louise. &ldquo;A member
of Mrs. Ferguson&rsquo;s gang came with a key. I
slipped out and locked her inside. That&rsquo;s why
we must hurry back, to catch her before she
escapes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary Louise rose from her chair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can we go now, Constable?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly. Yep, here comes my neighbor,
who often helps me make arrests. We&rsquo;ll take him
along in case your man or your prisoner gets
uppish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Could we take a mechanic to fix my car,
too?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s frozen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One of the kids will phone to the garage
right now to send somebody out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They gathered up the treasure, and, leaving
it in Mrs. Hodge&rsquo;s care, Mary Louise, the constable,
and the neighbor&mdash;a husky six-foot fellow&mdash;got
into the car. The distance which had
seemed so long to the girl an hour ago was covered
in less than five minutes.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_230">[230]</div>
<p>At the turn into the driveway, Mary Louise
saw the man who was waiting for her. Recognizing
the constable at once, he made a quick
dash to get away. But he was not fast enough:
the constable was out of the car in a second, commanding
him to stop and displaying his revolver.
With an oath on his lips he surrendered.</p>
<p>The constable&rsquo;s big friend took charge of him
while Mary Louise and the officer entered the
dark, cold house. The moment they opened the
door they heard a girl&rsquo;s terrified sobs from the
living room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who&mdash;are&mdash;you?&rdquo; she called, in a voice
choking with fear and misery.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Constable of Center Square and Mary
Louise Gay!&rdquo; replied the young detective.</p>
<p>The prisoner jumped to her feet and ran out
to the open door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mary&mdash;Louise&mdash;Gay!&rdquo; she repeated incredulously,
bursting afresh into tears.</p>
<p>But Mary Louise had identified her immediately.
She was Margaret Detweiler!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_231">[231]</div>
<h2 id="c17"><span class="small">CHAPTER XVII</span>
<br /><i>A Sad Story</i></h2>
<p>Mary Louise thought she had never seen anyone
change so much in the short space of two
years as Margaret Detweiler had changed. How
much older she looked, how much sadder, in
spite of her expensive clothes! What a strange,
trapped expression there was in her eyes, like
that of an animal caught in a cage!</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&mdash;are&mdash;going to arrest me?&rdquo; the girl
stammered, directing her question to the constable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am doing just what Miss Gay says, at the
present time,&rdquo; replied the man. &ldquo;So far, I don&rsquo;t
know that you&rsquo;re guilty of any crime.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no, don&rsquo;t arrest Margaret!&rdquo; protested
Mary Louise. &ldquo;I just can&rsquo;t believe that she is a
member of Mrs. Ferguson&rsquo;s gang. Why, it&rsquo;s too
impossible!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_232">[232]</div>
<p>&ldquo;No, it isn&rsquo;t impossible,&rdquo; said Margaret, more
calmly now. &ldquo;Mrs. Ferguson is a special kind
of criminal who makes young girls do her stealing
for her. She picks up country girls who
don&rsquo;t know anybody in the city and trains them....
Oh, it&rsquo;s a long story&mdash;and a sad one!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you mean to say that you did steal, Margaret?&rdquo;
demanded Mary Louise incredulously,
for she had never believed that story of Margaret&rsquo;s
theft at the department store. &ldquo;You must
tell me the truth! For the sake of your grandparents.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can honestly say that I have never stolen
anything in my life,&rdquo; replied the other girl
steadfastly. &ldquo;Mrs. Ferguson soon found out that
I was no good for that, so she made me guardian
of the treasure. I felt almost as wicked. But I
never stole.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank heaven for that!&rdquo; exclaimed Mary
Louise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But now I&rsquo;ve lost her valuables, and she&rsquo;ll
send me to prison,&rdquo; whimpered Margaret. &ldquo;Oh,
Mary Lou, did you take them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I took them. They&rsquo;re at the constable&rsquo;s
home now, and most of them belong to the guests
at Stoddard House in Philadelphia. But you
shan&rsquo;t suffer, Margaret, unless you&rsquo;re really
guilty.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_233">[233]</div>
<p>&ldquo;The young lady is very cold,&rdquo; remarked the
constable. &ldquo;Hadn&rsquo;t we better go back to my
house, where it&rsquo;s warm, till your car is fixed,
Miss Gay?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh yes, if you will let us!&rdquo; agreed Mary
Louise enthusiastically. She could see that Margaret&rsquo;s
teeth were chattering, and she remembered
how cold she herself had been after an
hour or so in that empty house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait until I get my other things,&rdquo; she said,
running back into the kitchen for the basket
which she had packed early that morning. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
put them into the car and see how soon the mechanic
thinks he will have it ready.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She returned in a couple of minutes and
found the others already seated in the constable&rsquo;s
sedan. Mary Louise was glad to find that the
officer had put Margaret Detweiler in front
with him, not beside the tough young man with
his huge guardian in the rear seat. She squeezed
in next to Margaret, and the car started.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The mechanic is going to drive my car to
your place in about half an hour,&rdquo; announced
Mary Louise. &ldquo;And then we&rsquo;ll start for Philadelphia.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fine!&rdquo; exclaimed the constable. &ldquo;That&rsquo;ll
give you girls a chance to get warm. And maybe
have a cup of coffee.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_234">[234]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s marvelous coffee,&rdquo; commented Mary
Louise. &ldquo;It just about saved my life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Not another word was said about the crimes
or the secret band. Margaret Detweiler was introduced
to Mrs. Hodge as a friend of Mary
Louise&rsquo;s from Riverside, and the two girls spent
a pleasant half hour in the constable&rsquo;s home,
sipping their freshly made coffee and looking
at the children&rsquo;s Christmas toys.</p>
<p>The constable, who had taken the young thug
away, returned just as Mary Louise&rsquo;s hired car
drove up to the door.</p>
<p>Mary Louise jumped up and reached for her
coat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait a minute!&rdquo; cautioned the constable.
&ldquo;Company&rsquo;s comin&rsquo; here to see you, Miss Gay! I
just met somebody askin&rsquo; for you at the hotel....
So don&rsquo;t be in too much of a rush!&rdquo;</p>
<p>From the obvious twinkle in the man&rsquo;s eyes,
Mary Louise believed that Max Miller must
have driven down to Philadelphia again and,
missing her there, had naturally traced her to
Center Square. But at that same moment a yellow
taxi stopped at the constable&rsquo;s gate, thereby
dispelling any such illusion. Max would never
ride in a taxicab on his limited allowance!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_235">[235]</div>
<p>The door of the cab opened, and a tall, handsome
man stepped out, paid the driver, and dismissed
the cab. It was Mary Louise&rsquo;s father.</p>
<p>Flinging open the door, the girl shouted at
him in delight, so loud that Mr. Gay heard her
in spite of the noise of the departing cab. In another
moment he entered the open door of the
house and held Mary Louise tightly in his arms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mary Lou!&rdquo; he cried in delight. &ldquo;Are you
sure you&rsquo;re all right?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m fine,&rdquo; she replied, ushering him into the
constable&rsquo;s house. &ldquo;Merry Christmas, Daddy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The same to you, dear.&rdquo; He gazed at her
fondly. &ldquo;I believe it will be&mdash;now. You certainly
look happy, Daughter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am, Daddy. These people have treated me
royally!&rdquo; She turned around and introduced her
father to Mrs. Hodge and the children, for he
had already met the constable. &ldquo;And, oh, Dad,
here is Margaret Detweiler,&rdquo; she added. &ldquo;You
remember her, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I certainly do,&rdquo; replied Mr. Gay, extending
his hand cordially. &ldquo;My, but your grandparents
are going to be glad to see you, Margaret!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl blushed and looked down at the floor
in embarrassment. Wisely, Mr. Gay asked no
questions.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_236">[236]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I have all the stolen valuables, Dad,&rdquo; continued
Mary Louise. &ldquo;Every single thing that
was taken from Stoddard House, and even the
money!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Gay gazed at his daughter in speechless
admiration: she had excelled his fondest
hopes!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mary Lou, that&rsquo;s&mdash;wonderful!&rdquo; he said after
a moment.... &ldquo;I have good news too. I
caught your thieves. Seven of &rsquo;em. They are in
a Baltimore jail now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Both girls exclaimed aloud in amazement and
delight. Margaret Detweiler started forward
and clutched the detective&rsquo;s arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s really true, Mr. Gay?&rdquo; she demanded
breathlessly. &ldquo;Mrs. Ferguson&mdash;is she in jail
too?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Locked up without any chance of getting out
on bail!&rdquo; he said authoritatively.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m so glad!&rdquo; murmured the girl thankfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now we&rsquo;ll be able to take the valuables right
back to their owners at Stoddard House, Constable
Hodge,&rdquo; announced Mary Louise. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
not afraid to carry them, with Dad beside me.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_237">[237]</div>
<p>Mrs. Hodge brought the jewelry and the
money from its hiding place and gave it all to
Detective Gay. Both he and Mary Louise tried
to thank the Hodges for their help and their
hospitality; Mr. Gay wanted to give the constable
some sort of recompense, but the good
man refused. Only after a great deal of persuasion
would he accept a five-dollar bill as a
Christmas present for his children.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ready, Daddy?&rdquo; inquired Mary Louise as
she slipped on her coat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just a minute,&rdquo; replied her father. &ldquo;I want
to telephone to Mrs. Hilliard to let her know
that you are safe. She&rsquo;s been terribly worried,
Mary Lou.... And shall I tell her that we&rsquo;ll
eat Christmas dinner with her at Stoddard
House?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes! I&rsquo;ve heard about the menu. There
won&rsquo;t be a sweller dinner anywhere in Philadelphia
than at Stoddard House. But shall we be
in time?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Gay consulted his watch. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s only a little
after eleven,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We ought to make it by
one o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As soon as the telephone call was completed,
the three people got into the little car. Mary
Louise herself took the wheel, for, as she explained,
she was familiar with it by this time.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_238">[238]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Now tell me about your experiences, Mary
Lou,&rdquo; urged her father, as soon as they were
well under way.</p>
<p>Mary Louise explained, for Margaret&rsquo;s benefit
as well as for her father&rsquo;s, about deciphering
the code letter and coming up to Center Square
and breaking into the empty house in search of
the valuables. But she made light of the coldness
and desolation of the dark house and of her
own hunger. She concluded with the statement
that Margaret had come that morning and let
her out with a key.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how did you happen to have the key,
Margaret?&rdquo; demanded Mr. Gay.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will have to tell you my whole story from
the beginning,&rdquo; answered the girl. There was a
tragic note in her voice, which drew out her listeners&rsquo;
sympathy, but neither made any comment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you can decide what to do with me,&rdquo;
she continued. &ldquo;I guess I deserve to go to prison,
but when I assure you that I have never done
anything wrong except under compulsion, maybe
you will not be so angry with me.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_239">[239]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re not angry with you, Margaret,&rdquo; Mary
Louise told her. &ldquo;Only terribly sorry. So please
tell us everything. You remember that your
grandparents have never heard anything from
you since last Christmas.... So begin your
story there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right.... Let me see&mdash;I was working
in that department store in Philadelphia, and
doing pretty well, for I got commissions besides
my salary on everything I sold. I started in the
cheap jewelry department and was promoted to
the expensive kind. Christmas brought me in a
lot of business, but I guess I overworked, for
I got sick the week before and had to stay home
and have the doctor. I&rsquo;d already spent a good
deal of money on presents, and when my doctor&rsquo;s
bill was paid I found my salary was all
gone. So I went back to the store before I should&mdash;on
the twenty-third of December, I remember.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The twenty-third of December!&rdquo; repeated
Mary Louise. &ldquo;That was the day Mrs. Ferguson
registered at the Benjamin Franklin Hotel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did you know, Mary Lou?&rdquo; demanded
Margaret.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I went to the hotel and looked through the
old register,&rdquo; she explained. &ldquo;But go on, Margaret.
What happened then?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_240">[240]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I found that a ring, an expensive diamond
ring, had been stolen from our department,&rdquo;
continued the girl. &ldquo;They insisted that it was
taken before I was away, but they couldn&rsquo;t prove
anything. Just the same, I know the store detective
had his eye on me.... Well, that very day
something else disappeared: a link bracelet.
This time they accused me immediately.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, except that I was the newest
salesgirl in the department&mdash;in fact, the only
girl. The store detective stepped behind my
counter and leaned down to the floor. <i>And he
picked that bracelet right out of my shoe!</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How dreadful!&rdquo; cried Mary Louise. &ldquo;Somebody
had &lsquo;planted&rsquo; it there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course. Mrs. Ferguson had, as I later
learned. But at the time I hadn&rsquo;t a suspicion.
She was standing right near the counter, examining
some rings. When she heard me accused
and told to leave the store, she stepped
forward, saying that she was sorry for me. She
asked me whether I had any family, and I told
her they were too far away for me to go to, without
any money.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;But you&rsquo;ll have trouble getting a job without
a reference,&rsquo; she said. &lsquo;So perhaps I had better
help you.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The sly cat!&rdquo; cried Mary Louise.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_241">[241]</div>
<p>Margaret nodded. &ldquo;But I didn&rsquo;t know it then.
I simply asked her whether she could get me
a job, and she told me to come to the Benjamin
Franklin Hotel that afternoon and ask for Mrs.
Ferguson.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, I went&mdash;I had nothing else to do.
She engaged me at once as her secretary. We
went out to Center Square for a few days, and
I met a lot of other girls. Two daughters, two
nieces, and a couple of friends. We had a good
time, but I didn&rsquo;t do any work, for she had two
servants and a chauffeur, and I felt as if I didn&rsquo;t
earn my pay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did she give you a salary?&rdquo; asked Mary
Louise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Margaret. &ldquo;For the first couple
of weeks. But I had to send it to my landlady
in Philadelphia. After that, Mrs. Ferguson
bought my clothes and paid my hotel bills,
but she never gave me any cash.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you couldn&rsquo;t get away!&rdquo; observed Mr.
Gay.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Exactly. Gradually I began to suspect that
there was something crooked about this bunch,
and then one day I found the diamond ring
which had been stolen from the store: among
Mrs. Ferguson&rsquo;s stuff at Center Square!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_242">[242]</div>
<p>&ldquo;What did you do?&rdquo; demanded Mary Louise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I showed it to her and said I was going to
take it right back to the store, and she stood
there and laughed at me. She said it would only
prove my own guilt!</p>
<p>&ldquo;The next day we all went to Washington and
stayed in different hotels. Mrs. Ferguson kept
me with her, but I soon saw through her tricks.
Her girls were all skilled hotel thieves. She
tried to teach me the business, as she called it,
but I refused to learn. So she made me take
charge of the stuff they stole. The girls would
bring their loot to her, and she&rsquo;d send me with
it to Center Square. Every once in a while she
would dispose of it all to a crooked dealer who
asked no questions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Were you out at Center Square last Sunday,
Margaret?&rdquo; interrupted Mary Louise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. Mrs. Ferguson and I both went. We
had intended to get the place ready to spend
Christmas there, but for some reason, Mrs. Ferguson
got scared. She said that Mary Green
talked too much, and she thought we ought to
clear out. She made plans to dispose of everything
in Baltimore, and then we were all going
to sail to Bermuda.... But why did you ask
that, Mary Lou?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_243">[243]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Because I was in that car that drove up to
the house then. I saw you and then Mrs. Ferguson.
I wouldn&rsquo;t have thought of its being you,
only Mary Green admitted that she knew you.
That made me suspicious.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You disappeared pretty quickly!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rather,&rdquo; laughed Mary Louise, and she told
the story of being hit over the head by a rock
and of catching the young man and having him
arrested that very morning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was clever!&rdquo; approved her father.
&ldquo;Who was he, Margaret?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A neighborhood bum that Mrs. Ferguson
employs to watch the place and keep the people
away,&rdquo; replied the girl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I&rsquo;m afraid I interrupted you, Margaret,&rdquo;
apologized Mary Louise. &ldquo;Please go on
with your story.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There isn&rsquo;t much left to tell. I was too far
away from home to run away, without any
money, and I hadn&rsquo;t a single friend I could go
to. All the store people thought I was a thief,
so I knew there was no use asking their help. I
just kept on, from day to day, not knowing how
it would ever end and never expecting to see my
grandparents or my Riverside friends again.
Oh, you can&rsquo;t imagine how unhappy I have
been!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_244">[244]</div>
<p>She stopped talking, for emotion had overcome
her; tears were rolling down her cheeks.
Mary Louise laid her hand over Margaret&rsquo;s reassuringly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right now, isn&rsquo;t it, Daddy?&rdquo; she said.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll take you home to your grandparents.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I can&rsquo;t go back to them!&rdquo; protested the
other girl. &ldquo;How can I tell them what has happened?
They&rsquo;d be disgraced for life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can tell them you have been working
for a queer woman who wouldn&rsquo;t allow you to
write home,&rdquo; said Mr. Gay. &ldquo;A woman whose
mind was affected, for that is the truth. There
is no doubt that Mrs. Ferguson is the victim of
a diseased mind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t you ever tell on me?&rdquo; questioned
Margaret.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, of course not. It was in no way your
fault, child.... And now try to be happy. I
think I can find you a job in Herman&rsquo;s Hardware
store, right in Riverside. And you can live
with your grandparents. They need you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It seems almost too good to be true,&rdquo;
breathed the grateful girl.</p>
<p>Mary Louise turned to her father.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_245">[245]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Now for your story, Dad,&rdquo; she begged.
&ldquo;About capturing the thieves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think that had better be kept till dinner
time,&rdquo; replied Mr. Gay. &ldquo;This traffic we&rsquo;re approaching
will require all your attention, Mary
Lou. And besides, Mrs. Hilliard will want to
hear it too.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_246">[246]</div>
<h2 id="c18"><span class="small">CHAPTER XVIII</span>
<br /><i>Conclusion</i></h2>
<p>Mary Louise brought the car to a stop at Stoddard
House at a quarter to one. Carrying the
money and the jewels in her father&rsquo;s briefcase,
and the other articles in the basket, she and
Margaret went into the hotel to get ready for
dinner while Mr. Gay returned the hired car
to the garage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll notify the police that you&rsquo;re found,
Mary Lou,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ll call your
mother. I think it will be best if she goes over
to your grandparents, Margaret, and tells them
about you herself. They haven&rsquo;t a telephone, and
I don&rsquo;t like to frighten elderly people with telegrams.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Both girls nodded their approval to these suggestions
and hurried into the hotel. Mrs. Hilliard
was waiting for Mary Louise with open
arms; she loved the young detective like a
daughter.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_247">[247]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Now, run along, girls, and get ready for dinner,&rdquo;
she said finally. &ldquo;We are going to have one
big table, instead of all the little ones in the
dining room. With a tree in the center, and
place cards, just like a jolly family party.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s swell!&rdquo; exclaimed Mary Louise.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;ll be real Christmas after all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And thank you so much for the lovely handkerchiefs,
dear,&rdquo; added the manager. &ldquo;It was
sweet of you to think of me.... That reminds
me, you haven&rsquo;t had your presents yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Put them at my place at the table,&rdquo; suggested
Mary Louise. &ldquo;And I&rsquo;ll have presents for some
of the guests,&rdquo; she added, with a significant
glance at the briefcase and basket.</p>
<p>When the girls returned to the first floor, after
washing their faces and powdering their noses,
they found Mr. Gay waiting for them. For a
moment he did not see them, so intent was he in
the newspaper he was reading.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Want to see the gang&rsquo;s picture?&rdquo; he asked
when Mary Louise came to his side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh yes! Please!&rdquo;</p>
<p>In spite of the fact that it was Christmas Day,
a large photograph of Mrs. Ferguson and her
six accomplices occupied much of the front page
of this Philadelphia paper. In an inset above
the picture of the crooks was Mary Louise&rsquo;s
smiling face!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_248">[248]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Daddy!&rdquo; cried the girl in amazement. &ldquo;Are
you responsible for this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am,&rdquo; replied her father proudly. &ldquo;I want
everybody to know that the credit belongs to
you, Daughter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Other guests, who had not yet read their newspapers,
crowded about Mr. Gay eager for the
exciting news. They all remembered Pauline
Brooks, and Mary Green; several of them identified
the two transients who had stolen the other
things from Stoddard House.</p>
<p>A loud gong sounded from the dining room,
and Mrs. Hilliard threw open the doors. The
room was beautifully decorated with greens and
holly; a long table stretched out before them,
covered with a lovely lace cloth and bearing a
small Christmas tree as its centerpiece. Bright
red ribbons had been stretched from the tree to
each guest&rsquo;s place, adding brilliancy to the
spectacle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello, Mary Louise!&rdquo; said a voice behind
the young detective, and, turning around, Mary
Louise saw Mrs. Weinberger behind her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Merry Christmas, Mrs. Weinberger!&rdquo; she
replied. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s nice to see you back here.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_249">[249]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve come back to stay,&rdquo; announced the older
woman. &ldquo;I got lonely at the Bellevue. And Mrs.
Macgregor is here too, for Christmas dinner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was a happy group who finally found their
places around the beautiful table and sat down.
Mrs. Hilliard was at one end, and Miss Stoddard
was honored with the seat at the other end.
Mr. Gay was the only man present, but he did
not seem in the least embarrassed.</p>
<p>Mary Louise found her pile of presents at her
place, and Margaret Detweiler discovered a
bunch of violets and a box of candy at hers.
Even in his haste, Mr. Gay had remembered
the lonely girl.</p>
<p>The guests ate their oyster cocktails and their
mushroom soup before any formal announcement
concerning the valuables was made. Then
Mrs. Hilliard rose from her chair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As you all know from the papers, our criminals
have been caught by Mary Louise Gay and
her father, and are now in prison. But even better
news than that is coming. I&rsquo;ll introduce Mr.
Gay, whom some of you know already, and he&rsquo;ll
tell you more about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Everybody clapped as the famous detective
stood up.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_250">[250]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to make a speech,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;and keep you waiting for the turkey we&rsquo;re all
looking forward to. I just thought that maybe
some of you would enjoy this wonderful dinner
even more if you knew that you are going to get
everything back again which was stolen. My
daughter found all the valuables and the money
this morning in Mrs. Ferguson&rsquo;s house at Center
Square, and she will now return them to their
rightful owners.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the newspaper had not mentioned anything
about the stolen goods, the guests were not
prepared for this pleasant surprise. A loud burst
of applause greeted Mary Louise as she smilingly
rose to her feet and opened the briefcase
and drew out the basket from under the table
where she had hidden it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll begin at the beginning,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;With
the vase and the silverware belonging to Stoddard
House.&rdquo; She carried these articles to Mrs.
Hilliard, amid appreciative hand-clapping.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Next, Miss Granger&rsquo;s picture and her fifty
dollars,&rdquo; she continued.</p>
<p>Tears actually came to the artist&rsquo;s eyes as she
took the painting from Mary Louise&rsquo;s hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You keep the fifty dollars, Miss Gay,&rdquo; she
said. &ldquo;My picture is what I care for most.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_251">[251]</div>
<p>&ldquo;No, Miss Granger, no, thank you,&rdquo; replied
the girl solemnly. &ldquo;I am being paid a salary for
my work by Mrs. Hilliard, but I can&rsquo;t accept
rewards for doing my duty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She picked up the watches next: Mrs. Weinberger&rsquo;s
and Mrs. Hilliard&rsquo;s. The Walder girls
would get theirs when they returned from their
holidays.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And, last of all, Mrs. Macgregor&rsquo;s diamond
earrings and her five hundred dollars,&rdquo; she concluded,
restoring the jewelry and the bills to the
delighted woman. &ldquo;I believe that is all, for I am
wearing my own wrist-watch, and I have my
purse with its five dollars contents.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Loud cheering accompanied the applause
which followed. When it had at last quieted
down, both Mrs. Weinberger and Mrs. Macgregor
tried in vain to give Mary Louise a reward,
but she remained firm in her refusal.
Then the turkeys were brought to the dining
room, and everything else was temporarily forgotten
in the enjoyment of Christmas dinner.</p>
<p>When it was all over, Mr. Gay told Mary
Louise to pack her clothing and her presents
while he returned the remaining valuables to
the Ritz and to the police. &ldquo;For I hope we can
make the three-thirty train,&rdquo; he explained.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_252">[252]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But with that change at the Junction, we&rsquo;d
have to wait all night, shouldn&rsquo;t we, Daddy?&rdquo;
inquired Mary Louise. Anxious as she was to get
back to Riverside, she had no desire to spend
the night in a cheerless railway station.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied her father. &ldquo;Because there&rsquo;s
going to be a surprise waiting for you at the
Junction.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Max and Norman?&rdquo; guessed Mary Louise
instantly. &ldquo;You mean that they&rsquo;ll drive down for
us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Gay nodded. &ldquo;That isn&rsquo;t all,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Mary Louise did not guess the rest of the answer
until the train pulled into the Junction
shortly after eight o&rsquo;clock that night. Then a
war whoop that could come from no one else
but her small brother greeted her ears, and she
knew that her mother must be there too. Yes,
and there was her chum, Jane Patterson, grinning
at her from the boys&rsquo; car! And her little
dog, Silky!</p>
<p>In another minute Mary Louise was clasping
her arms around Mrs. Gay and hugging
Freckles and Jane and Silky all at once. Max, at
her side, had to be content with pressing her
arm affectionately.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_253">[253]</div>
<p>Questions, Christmas greetings, words of joy
and congratulation poured so fast upon Mary
Louise&rsquo;s ears that she could scarcely understand
them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re home to stay, darling?&rdquo; This from
her mother.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll go to the senior prom with me?&rdquo; demanded
Max.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re the most famous girl detective in the
world!&rdquo; shouted Norman Wilder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You were a lemon to duck my party, but I&rsquo;ll
give another one just in your honor,&rdquo; promised
Jane.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you get your salary&mdash;your twenty-five
bucks?&rdquo; asked Freckles.</p>
<p>Mary Louise nodded, smiling, to everything.
Then she got into Max&rsquo;s car beside him, with
Jane and Norman in the rumble seat. Mr. Gay
took the wheel of his sedan, with his wife beside
him; Margaret Detweiler, who was
quietly watching everything, sat behind with
Freckles.</p>
<p>The drivers of the two cars did not stop for
any food on the way; they sped along as fast as
they dared towards Riverside. Old Mr. and
Mrs. Detweiler were waiting up for their precious
granddaughter, their lost Margaret.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_254">[254]</div>
<p>A little before midnight the cars pulled up
in front of the old couple&rsquo;s home, and everybody
in the party went inside for a moment. The
greeting between Margaret and her grandparents
was touching to see. Even Norman Wilder,
who prided himself on being &ldquo;hard-boiled,&rdquo;
admitted afterwards that the tears came to his
eyes.</p>
<p>Mrs. Gay discreetly drew her own party
away, back to her home, where a feast was waiting
for the travelers. This, Mary Louise felt,
was her real Christmas celebration&mdash;with her
family and her three dearest friends. Now she
could tell her story and listen to the praises
which meant so much to her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the best part of it all,&rdquo; she concluded, &ldquo;is
that I&rsquo;m a real professional detective at last!&rdquo;</p>
